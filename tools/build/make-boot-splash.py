"""Makes the Kei boot splash the loaders draw full-screen (ws035-p107).

Copyright (C) 2026 Awe Morris; SPDX-License-Identifier: Zlib

The splash is userland/desktop/artwork/kei-boot-splash.png (the project
owner's picture, allowed in the tree on 2026-09-28): the glass mark, the word
Kei, "powered by zedBSD" and a dotted spinner over a bright blurred lake.
This script turns it into what the UEFI and the BIOS loaders read (logo=):

- the spinner is taken out of the picture (its place is filled from the
  sky and water around it), because the kernel draws a spinner that moves
  there (src/drivers/platform/pcat/graphics/splash.c);
- the picture is scaled to WIDTHxHEIGHT (1920x1080 by default, the GOP mode
  the UEFI loader asks for, 16:9 like the picture) with bilinear sampling;
- the result is a binary PPM whose header carries the comment "fit=contain"
  (ws035-p112): a loader then draws it whole in the middle of a black
  screen, at its own size when the screen holds it, else shrunk with its
  proportions kept; the sides it does not reach are black bars.  The kernel's
  splash.c knows the 1920x1080.

The spinner's place is a contract with the kernel's splash.c: in the
picture's coordinates its centre is at the middle of the width and at
SPINNER_Y of the height, its ring's radius SPINNER_RING of the height.

Only the Python standard library is used (zlib for the PNG).  The output is
the same for the same input.
