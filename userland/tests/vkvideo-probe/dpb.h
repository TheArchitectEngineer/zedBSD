 * Vulkan Video leaves the DPB to the application: which pictures are
 * references, in which slots, and which slot each new picture is written
 * into.  The probe gives every slot its own picture (slot n is image n),
 * keeps H.264's reference marking (8.2.5: the sliding window and the memory
 * management operations 1 to 4 and 6, for frames), and plans each decode:
 * the references and their StdVideoDecodeH264ReferenceInfo, a free slot
 * for the new picture, and the slots the decoder still holds that no
 * longer hold a reference (deactivated in the coding scope's begin).
