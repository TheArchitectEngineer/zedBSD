 * The touch screen of the browser's window (ws081-p006,
 * plan/ws081/design.md section 5).
 *
 * A finger (or two, by their centroid) drags the page, and a flick glides
 * on (libkeiland's scroller): past either end of the document the content
 * stretches and springs back (the view's overscroll); a touch catches a
 * glide.  A tap is a click of the primary button (two quick taps are two
 * clicks, which the page reads as a double click); a long press lifted
 * without moving is a click of the secondary button.  A scroll placed
 * otherwise (the wheel, a key, a link, another page) is taken over: a
 * glide stops there, and a finger down drags on from it.
 *
 * Nothing here speaks Wayland or the view: the window queues the wl_touch
 * events, the main loop hands them here with the page's scroll and range
 * each round, and takes the scroll, the overscroll and the pointer's
 * events made here.
