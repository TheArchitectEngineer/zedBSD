 * A face's companions (ws090-p020): the files a desktop installs beside
 * its font, which the face draws with as if they were one font.
 *
 * The bold companion holds the face's own glyphs in a bold weight, in the
 * same order (the desktop's Mahora Regular and Mahora Bold): while the face
 * is bold, a glyph of its own is drawn from it as it is, not widened.  The
 * next companion draws the characters the face lacks (the desktop's
 * monospaced fallback, for the signs and the Latin letters Mahora does not
 * have yet): truetype_glyph_index finds them there and numbers them after
 * the face's own glyphs, and every call given such a number draws from the
 * companion at the face's size and weight (widened when bold).  The calls
 * in design units scale a companion's units to the face's em.
 *
 * The face's line (truetype_metrics, truetype_design_metrics) stays its
 * own, so that whether a companion is installed never moves a layout.  A
 * companion that cannot be read is left out: the face draws what it has.
