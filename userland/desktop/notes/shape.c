 *
 * A stroke's ink is a list of shapes, each a polygon the screen and the PDF
 * fill alike.  The pen's and the highlighter's come from the pressure as
 * they always did.  The brush's, the pencil's and the watercolour's widths
 * follow factors that formulas give each sample (the speed, the taper, a
 * wobble of the watercolour's edges), and the pencil's darkness follows
 * steps of the pressure; when a stroke is put on a page those values are
 * baked into it (notes_stroke_bake()), so that its shapes depend on its
 * samples, its baked values and the tool's constants only.  Until then the
 * formulas give them afresh, with the stroke's end where it is now.
 *
 * The pencil's grain is a tile of 8-bit coverage made from integers only,
 * so that every machine makes the same bytes; the PDF repeats it as a
 * pattern and the screen as a texture.
