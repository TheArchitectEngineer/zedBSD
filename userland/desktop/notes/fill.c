 * The area the fill tool paints (ws216-p005, plan/ws216/phase005/phase.md
 * section 2): from a point of a page, the run of pixels of the point's
 * colour around it, its small gaps closed, turned into contours of page
 * points.
 *
 * The page is drawn at a fixed scale whatever the zoom (at most 4 pixels a
 * point), a band of rows at a time, by a caller's function (fill-page.c
 * draws it with the GPU).  Each band's rows go into a table of the whole
 * page: a pixel is a border where any channel differs from the seed's by
 * more than NOTES_FILL_THRESHOLD, the borders are widened by FILL_CLOSE points
 * so that small gaps close, and the fill floods the pixels that are not
 * covered, four neighbours at a time, the page's edge its border too.  A
 * row is flooded only once every row within the widening of it was read,
 * so the area does not depend on how the page was cut into bands; a band
 * is read when the flood waits for its rows.  The area is then widened
 * back (by the closing, the border's soft edge and FILL_UNDER points) so
 * that it reaches under the lines that bound it, its edge is followed
 * pixel by pixel, and the contours are simplified within a tolerance,
 * small ones dropped, and put on the edit data's grid.
 *
 * Nothing here uses Vulkan: the pixels arrive in host memory.
