/*
 * The media picker (ws197-p014): the window every application shares to
 * choose photos and videos of the user's media library.
 *
 * It is made as the file chooser is (chooser.c): a toplevel window of its
 * own on the application's connection (keiui_window_open_shared), drawn
 * with the widgets on the CPU into wl_shm buffers, on the compositor's
 * glass where it has glass (one frosted panel under the window and the
 * card on it) and on Files' pale ground elsewhere, a sheet under the
 * parent's title bar where the compositor has sheets.  Its objects live on
 * the application's default queue, so its input, configures and frames
 * run while the application dispatches that queue.  The window wakes the
 * picker after the events that queued its input; the picker draws at most
 * once a frame and keeps asking for frames while the grid glides or
 * thumbnails in sight are still being made by its thread.
 *
 * The list is the library's metadata (kl_system_media_list), read once
 * when the picker opens; the picker never reads the library's database.
 * The answer is told through the listener from a wl_display.sync callback
 * after the window is gone, so that the application may destroy the picker
 * from its callback.
