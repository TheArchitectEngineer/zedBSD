/*
 * The scroller (WS081 p005, plan/ws081/design.md section 5): content a
 * finger drags, flings and pulls past its bounds.
 *
 * Each axis keeps its raw position: where the finger put it, past a bound
 * too.  What is drawn past a bound is the rubber band of the raw distance,
 * f(d) = L c d / (c |d| + L), which resists more the further it goes and
 * never reaches the viewport's size L.  A fling slows by
 * dv/dt = -v/tau - mu sign(v): v(t) = (v0 + mu tau) e^(-t/tau) - mu tau,
 * which stops at t = tau ln(1 + v0 / (mu tau)).  A diagonal fling gives
 * each axis its share of mu, so both axes stop together and the direction
 * holds.  An axis that passes a bound hands its velocity to a critically
 * damped spring on the raw distance, d(t) = (d0 + (v0 + w d0) t) e^(-w t),
 * and a spring that crosses the bound inwards hands its velocity back to a
 * fling.  The position is a closed form of the time within each phase.
 *
 * It is the one inertia of every program (ws090-p019, BUG-211): a touch
 * screen's finger drags and flings it (kl_scroller_press, _drag,
 * _release); a touch pad's two fingers drag it too, and their velocity,
 * worked out from their last moves at the compositor's times (the track
 * below, kl_axis_track), flings it when they lift (kl_scroller_axis,
 * _axis_stop).
