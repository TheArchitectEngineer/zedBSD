 * The gestures of a touch surface (WS081 p005, plan/ws081/design.md
 * section 5.6): tap, double tap, long press, drag with one or more fingers,
 * pinch and cancel, told apart the same way in every program.
 *
 * A touch starts a press.  A press that moves 8 px (the fingers' centroid)
 * becomes a drag; one held for 500 ms without moving is a long press; one
 * that lifts first is a tap.  A second finger turns a press into one that
 * can only drag.  The drag follows the centroid of the fingers down: when
 * a finger joins or lifts, the drag's offset keeps its value and follows
 * the new centroid from there, so the content does not jump.  Every finger
 * feeds a touch motion (motion.c), which resamples the centroid for the
 * frame being drawn and gives the last finger's velocity at the lift.
