 * Every change is a step: text inserted or deleted at a position, with the
 * cursor and the selection before and after it.  Steps of one group are
 * undone and redone together (a paste over a selection is a deletion and
 * an insertion).  Characters typed one after another, and Backspace or
 * Delete pressed again and again, grow the step before instead of adding
 * one, so that Undo takes back a word or a run of deletions at once.  The
 * history remembers how many steps were done when the document was saved,
