/*
 * The applications that open files: which ones fit a file, and starting
 * one on it (spec §14).
 *
 * The ways to open a file come, the first being the default, from the way
 * the user chose for the file's type (Always Open With, ws093-p003), then
 * from three lists, the first match of the earliest list first: the user's
 * own $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/keiland/open-with, the system's
 * /etc/keiland/open-with, and the built-in table below.  A list's line is
 *
 *	PATTERNS<TAB>NAME<TAB>COMMAND
 *
 * where PATTERNS are MIME-type globs separated by commas (a star stands for
 * any characters, as in the shell), NAME is what the window shows, and
 * COMMAND is run by the shell with %f standing for the file's path, quoted
 * for the shell (the path is added at the end when there is no %f).  A command that starts
 * with "@terminal " runs the rest in a new terminal window; "@quicklook"
 * shows the file in Quick Look.  Lines starting with '#' are comments.
 *
 * The lists are read each time a file is opened, so an edit takes effect
 * at once, and nothing of them is kept between openings.  Files only reads
 * them: the lists are the user's and the system's to write.
 *
 * The way chosen for a type is the desktop's setting
 * files.open-with.<type> (libkeiland's kl_settings_*, WS135: "<name><TAB>
 * <command>", kept by libkeiland in ~/.config/keiland/files.conf); Files
 * opens no settings file itself.  The lines an earlier Files wrote into the
 * user's list after a "# set by Files" comment are not read any more.
