/*
 * The touch screen of Files (ws081-p010, plan/ws081/design.md section 5).
 *
 * Over the items or the sidebar, a finger (or two) drags to scroll, and a
 * flick glides on (libkeiland's scroller; past either end it stretches and
 * springs back); a touch catches it.  A tap is a click of the left button
 * (two quick taps open, as a double click does); a long press is the right
 * button's click (the context menu) when the finger lifts without moving,
 * and a press of the left button held where it pressed when the finger
 * then moves (dragging the items -- a drag and drop with the finger,
 * ws081-p014 -- or a rubber band).  Anywhere else (the toolbar, the tabs,
 * the fields, a dialog) the first finger is the left button: it presses
 * where it touches, moves the pointer and releases where it lifts.
 *
 * Nothing here speaks Wayland: the window queues the wl_touch events, the
 * main loop hands them here with what is under a finger and the scrolls
 * each round, and takes the scrolls and the pointer's events made here.
