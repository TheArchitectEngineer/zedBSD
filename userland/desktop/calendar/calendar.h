 * Calendar (WS155): Keiland's calendar.  The months one under another, a
 * week or a day, with the events of four calendars, a sidebar, a panel to
 * add an event by dragging its kind (an icon drawn in 3D, render3d.h and
 * scene.h) onto a date and to edit it, the application's one memo
 * (dragged onto a date, it is kept there as a memo), and the day chosen
 * with a small desk calendar in 3D that turns its page when the day
 * changes.  The events and memos are kept under ~/Documents/Calendar as
 * iCalendar files (store.c, plan/ws155/phase001/phase.md).
 *
 * The view (view.c) draws a frame with libkeiland's canvas and widgets and
 * knows nothing of the window, so that the host tests draw it into
 * pictures; the window (main.c) feeds it the input and the time.
