/*
 * The network's backend of Settings (ws089-p003, WS131 p011): the
 * compositor's network through libkeiland's kl_system_* (system.c opens
 * it) -- the daemon's state and scans as the compositor tells them, the
 * interfaces, the DNS servers and the saved networks as its details, asked
 * for once a second -- and the requests the network pages make: the Wi-Fi
 * switch, a join, a disconnect, and a join with a new key (the compositor
 * saves the key, tells the daemon and joins, answering once).
 *
 * There is no Scan button (ws089-p021, the user's request of 2026-10-04):
 * while a page that lists the networks around is shown (Network, Wi-Fi),
 * Settings asks the compositor to keep the radios scanning
 * (kl_system_network_set_scanning) and the list follows each new scan; the
 * scan the compositor already has is listed at once.  Leaving those pages
 * or closing the window asks no longer.  The compositor counts every
 * window that asks, its own Wi-Fi menu included, so two Settings windows,
 * or Settings and the menu, keep the scans going until the last one stops.
 * An asking holds a minute in the compositor, so Settings asks again every
 * NETWORK_SCANNING_RENEW_MS while it shows the list (a Settings that hangs
 * stops keeping the radios busy).
 *
 * One network request is out at a time, the system bar's included.  A
 * switch, a disconnect or a join asked for while Settings' own request is
 * out waits in one slot and is sent when that one is answered, rather
 * than being refused (ws089-p012 C1, the system bar's way since
 * ws005-p019); one the compositor answered busy (the system bar's request
 * was out) waits there a moment and is sent again.  The asking for scans is
 * no request and never takes the slot.
 *
 * Nothing here waits: the main loop calls se_network_poll every round, and
 * the answers arrive through system.c.
 *
 * The Wi-Fi switch shows the position asked at once (BUG-183), and a new
 * key moves from its form to the join when it is confirmed, so the form
 * closes while the join is under way and opens again, empty, when the key
 * did not work (BUG-186); the key is kept until the join is answered (a
 * busy answer sends it again) and wiped then.  Settings never speaks networkd's
 * protocol, nor reads the network's files, itself (plan/ws089/design.md
 * section 6, plan/ws131/design.md section 4).
