 * The Storage page's analysis of a folder's use (ws089-p023).
 *
 * The root's entries are read first: each folder becomes a group (beyond
 * SE_SCAN_GROUPS - 2 of them, "Other folders" takes the rest), and the
 * files directly in the root count for "Files here".  Each folder is then a
 * job that the workers take from a shared list: a worker reads its
 * entries, adds its files' bytes to its group, and puts its sub-folders on
 * the list for its group.  The bytes are those the file takes on the disk
 * (st_blocks, as du counts them); a file of a few links counts once; no
 * symbolic link is followed and no other file system is entered (as du
 * -x), so the totals agree with du -sx.  A folder that cannot be read is
 * counted apart and passed over.
 *
 * A stop is looked at between entries, so the workers end within a moment
 * and what they counted stays.  The workers are joined by se_scan_stop
 * or, once they ended by themselves, by se_scan_finish.
