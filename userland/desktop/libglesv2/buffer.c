/*
 * Buffer objects and the device memory under all of zedBSD's OpenGL ES
 * (WS068 p008), and OpenGL ES 3's buffer and vertex array calls (WS068
 * p024).
 *
 * A buffer object keeps its bytes on the CPU; a draw copies them into a
 * host-visible device buffer when they changed.  The stream is memory for
 * one frame (client arrays, converted indices, uniform values), handed
 * out front to back and reset when the frame is done, as are the
 * descriptor pools; the garbage holds device objects a frame still uses.
 * Uploads to images go through one command buffer that is submitted and
 * waited for at once.
 *
 * glMapBufferRange hands out the CPU bytes themselves (what the GPU
 * wrote into the device copy, by transform feedback or a compute shader's
 * storage blocks, is read back first: gles_buffer_fetch), and unmapping
 * marks the device copy stale like glBufferSubData.  A vertex
 * array object is a saved copy of the attributes' arrays and the element
 * buffer: binding one saves the context's into the one bound before and
 * loads its own.
