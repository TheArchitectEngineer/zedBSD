 * One copy of a program, and the activation.
 *
 * A program that keeps one window (Settings) runs once per user: a second
 * start hands its request -- a line of text the program gives meaning to,
 * such as a page to open -- to the copy that runs, with an activation
 * token, and ends.  The copy that runs takes the request, carries it out
 * and brings its window to the front with the token (kl_activate).  The
 * copies find each other through a socket in the user's runtime directory
 * (XDG_RUNTIME_DIR), which must be the user's own and closed to others.
 * The copy that runs binds itself to its application (kl_instance_bind):
 * the requests then arrive as the application's KL_APP_INSTANCE events.
 *
 * An activation token is a compositor's permission to bring a window to
 * the front (xdg_activation_v1).  A program started by the desktop has one
 * in XDG_ACTIVATION_TOKEN; a program may ask the compositor for one to
 * hand to a program it starts (kl_activation_token).
