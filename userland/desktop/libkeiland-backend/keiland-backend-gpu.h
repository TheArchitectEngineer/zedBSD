 * The GPU buffers between the Keiland compositor and its operating system
 * (WS131 p009, plan/ws131/design.md section 3.5).
 *
 * libkeiland-backend owns the protocol of the clients' GPU buffers: the
 * global's name and version, the requests' decoding, the checks of a
 * buffer's description, its import into the compositor's Vulkan device,
 * and on Linux and FreeBSD the dma-buf modifiers and the export of the
 * implicit acquire fence.  The compositor keeps the wire objects, the
 * wl_buffer's lifetime, the images it draws and the surfaces' acquire
 * fences; it lends them to the backend through struct
 * kl_backend_protocol_host, whose resources are the compositor's wire
 * objects as opaque handles.  This header names Vulkan types and is
 * included only where Vulkan is.

 *

 *       client of parent (a client's new_id, or one the server numbers)
 *   resource_find   the client's object of an id, NULL unless it has the
 *       role (a buffer of shared memory is not a GPU buffer)
 *   resource_destroy, resource_role, resource_id, resource_version,
 *   client_number, resource_private (the backend's own record, NULL at
 *       first, freed by the backend in kl_backend_gpu_resource_free)
 *   emit, post_error (a protocol error that ends the client: code, or the
 *       generic invalid-request error when code is UINT32_MAX)
 *   take_fd   the next fd the client sent, or -1 when it has not arrived
 *   buffer_adopt   gives a buffer its imported image (the compositor owns
 *       the image and the memory from then on, and frees them on failure)
 *   buffer_set_alpha   opaque (0) or premultiplied alpha (1); the next
 *       frame is drawn again
 *   surface_fence   joins a fence to the surface's next commit; ENOSPC
 *       when the surface has as many as it takes (the fd is the caller's
 *       then), 0 when the surface owns it
 *   surface_fence_full   whether no more fences can join
 *   device   the Vulkan device of any resource's compositor, NULL before it
 *       is made
 *   log_frames   whether the per-frame log lines were asked for
