 * The phone on zedBSD (ws197-p004a, plan/ws197/phase004/phase.md section
 * 5): bluetoothd's PHONE lines on /run/bluetoothd.sock.  ws197-p005
 * (plan/ws197/phase005/phase.md section 6.2) adds the pages of the
 * phone's contacts and calls (PHONE CONTACT with its reduced vCard, PHONE
 * CALL-LOG with no text) and the contacts' state.
 *
 * Three connections, none waited for:
 *
 *   the events       PHONE SUBSCRIBE, then PHONE STATE, PHONE MESSAGE
 *                    with its text, PHONE SENT and PHONE DROPPED as they
 *                    come (the owner of the phone only);
 *   the pages        PHONE PAGE, one at a time, at most four waiting;
 *   the requests     PHONE SEND, READ, LINK and SHOW, one at a time, at
 *                    most thirty-two waiting (a text sent never waits
 *                    behind a page).
 *
 * bluetoothd answers a request up to its DONE (ERROR <word> before it when
 * it failed) and drops a line written while it answers, so the next
 * request of a connection is written after the DONE.  A request answered
 * by nothing in two minutes fails with ETIMEDOUT and its connection is
 * made again.  A daemon that is not running is not a failure: the state
 * is unreachable and the events are asked for again every second.
 *
 * When the events are refused (not the owner, or no phone), the record is
 * read with SHOW every thirty seconds, and the events asked for again as
 * soon as it says the phone is this user's.  Nothing is kept on disk and
 * no number, name or text is logged.
 *
 * The connections are a thread's of their own (daemon-link-zedbsd.h): it
 * connects (which may wait), writes and reads, and reads an MMS's body
 * from its file and writes a received one to a file of its own.  The event
 * loop's calls copy what the thread published, number the requests and
 * hand them over; none of them waits.  A request the thread cannot queue
 * is answered by a result with its errno value.
