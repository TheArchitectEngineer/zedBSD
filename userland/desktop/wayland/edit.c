 *
 * kl_edit_v1: a window that asks for it (kl_edit_manager_v1.get_edit;
 * libkeiland's windows do) tells which editing operations it carries out and
 * its state -- whether it has a selection, something to paste, something
 * to undo or redo, and whether a selection is being made -- and hears the
 * operations as actions.  kwl_edit_action sends an operation to the
 * focused window: as an action to a window with the protocol, otherwise as
 * the keys it stands for (Ctrl+C, X, V, Z, Y, A; Ctrl+Shift+C and V for a
 * terminal, by its application ID).  kwl_edit_state reads which operations
 * the focused window can take now, for the buttons' grey.
 *
 * kwl_focus_previous brings the window focused before the one on top
 * forward (the second in the stacking order, which a raise and the focus
 * follow): twice goes back.  The on-screen keyboard stays open.
 *
 * Until the tool face exists, Super+Alt with C, X, V, Z, Y, A, S (select
 * begin), E (select end) and P (the previous application) call these, and
 * Super+Alt+Q logs what kwl_edit_state reads; Super+Alt+H logs the
 * clipboard's history and Super+Alt+1 ... 0 pastes its items 1 ... 10
 * (clipboard.c; the tests use them).
