 * The rules of the compositor's sleep (ws052-p012, the design of
 * plan/ws052/phase007/phase.md sections 0 and 3 to 5): when a sleep may
 * begin, when its request is sent, what an answer leaves behind (the
 * growing pauses after failures, a sleep that cannot happen at all, the
 * rest after a wake that was not the user's), which presses and keys are
 * not the user's, and what an answer's reason is in the user's words.
 *
 * It knows nothing of the server: sleep.c hands it the time, the frames
 * drawn and the answers, and carries out what it decides.  So the host
 * tests run it alone.
