 * The glass maps: the colour of glass at every output pixel, worked out
 * beforehand, and pictures of the whole output that do not change.
 *
 * Flat glass (a window's panels, its blurred desktop) samples the blurred
 * wallpaper at its own place on the output and whitens or darkens it by its
 * colour; nothing else of the shape changes the colour of its inside.  So
 * for one colour the inside's colour depends on the output pixel alone,
 * and the panel shader that works it out (its inside variant, over the
 * same blurred wallpaper) can write it for every pixel of an image of the
 * output's size once.  The inside of such glass is then drawn by the map
 * variant (KWL_PANEL_INSIDE_MAP), which reads the map at the pixel itself
 * (nearest sampling, at the texel's centre): the same bytes, without the
 * per-pixel arithmetic.  Glass with a sheen from the top depends on its
 * box too; only glass over the whole output (Wiseview's, App Home's stage)
 * is mapped so, its box being the output's.
 *
 * A glass's map is made once two frames asked for it (a shape seen once,
 * or one whose key moves, is not worth a pass over the whole output, nor
 * the map of a lasting one), drawn before the next frame's own pass
 * (kwl_glass_maps_inband), and used from then on; meanwhile the glass is
 * drawn as before.  A map is drawn again
 * when the blurred wallpaper changes, and all go with the output's size.
 * Plain flat glass in the light appearance (no colour, not lifted) is the
 * blurred wallpaper itself, read by the same variant with its own linear
 * sampling, and needs no map.
 *
 * A whole-output picture (App Home's stage: its glass and its light) is
 * drawn the same way by the function its user gives, the frame after the
 * first that asked; the frames then draw it as one opaque image.
 *
 * A soft shadow around a box depends only on the pixel's place from the
 * box, its size, corner radius, softness and colour: its picture (as far
 * as the shadow reaches) is drawn once, on transparent black, and a
 * shadow at a whole pixel's place is then drawn as that picture, blended,
 * instead of working out the distance to the box at every pixel.  The
 * picture holds the shadow's colour in the output's bytes, so the blend
 * may differ from the shadow worked out in the frame by a step of a byte.
