 * xdg_activation_v1 (ws089-p016): a program asks the compositor for a
 * token, hands it to another program, and that program brings one of its
 * windows to the front with it.  A second start of a program that keeps
 * one window (Settings) hands its request and its token to the first,
 * which activates its window with the token.
 *
 * A token is text the compositor makes from random bytes, good for one
 * activation within ACTIVATION_LIFE_MS.  It is granted -- an activation
 * with it brings the window -- when the client that asked for it has the
 * keyboard's focus (the user is working in it), or when the client is a
 * program that has just started and shows no window yet: such a program
 * could show a window of its own on top anyway, so handing that right to
 * another program's window grants nothing new.  A token not granted is
 * still given (a client cannot tell), and its activation does nothing.
 * The launcher (kwl_spawn) gives each program it starts a granted token in
 * XDG_ACTIVATION_TOKEN.
