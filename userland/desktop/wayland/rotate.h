/*
 * The arithmetic of a rotated display (rotate.c, WS217; the design is
 * plan/ws217/phase001/phase.md, sections 2, 4.6 and 4.10).
 *
 * A display has a physical size, its panel's rows and columns (the mode,
 * the swapchain, the scanout), and a logical one, the desktop the user sees
 * on it.  The rotation is the angle, clockwise in degrees (0, 90, 180 or
 * 270), by which the picture is turned on the panel; at 90 and 270 the
 * logical width is the physical height.  The display's hardware turns the
 * picture by 180 (the scanout rotation), the compositor's turn pass by 90
 * or 270 (the turn rotation); one of the two at most is not 0.
 *
 * Points are pixels (whole numbers, a pixel's index) or 24.8 fixed-point
 * coordinates; rectangles are half-open (left, top, right, bottom).  The
 * physical width and height are Wp and Hp.  A logical point (x, y) is shown
 * at the physical point:
 *
 *   0:   (x, y)
 *   90:  (Wp - 1 - y, x)
 *   180: (Wp - 1 - x, Hp - 1 - y)
 *   270: (y, Hp - 1 - x)
 *
 * Nothing here knows the server or Vulkan, so the host tests run it alone.
