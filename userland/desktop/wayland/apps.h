/*
 * The applications of a desktop (apps.c, ws142-p004): the windows of the
 * desktop shown, gathered into applications for the system bar's icons
 * (apps-bar.c) and the switcher.
 *
 * Windows with the same application ID are one application (two processes
 * of one program too); a window without one is an application of its own
 * client (D7).  The bar keeps an order of its own for each desktop: the
 * order the applications were opened in, new ones on the right, which the
 * user may change by dragging an icon (the 2026-10-05 request); the
 * switcher goes by the most recent use (D2).  Each application's windows
 * are the most recently raised first.
 *
 * It knows nothing of the server: the caller describes the windows, and
 * keeps each desktop's order between calls.  So the host tests run it
 * alone.
