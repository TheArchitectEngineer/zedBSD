/*
 * The arithmetic and the file of several displays shown at once
 * (displays.c, ws113-p004b; the design is plan/ws113/phase004/phase.md,
 * "p004b").
 *
 * The compositor shows every connected display in one of two modes
 * (D-MODES): extended, where each display shows its own part of one
 * logical plane, or mirror, where every display shows the same desktop.
 * In the extended mode each display is a rectangle of the plane: signed
 * integer coordinates, half-open (a display at x 0 of width 1920 covers
 * x 0 .. 1919), no two overlapping, and all of them joined by edges they
 * share.  A display connected while the compositor runs goes right of the
 * rightmost one (D-HOTPLUG).  In the mirror mode a display of another
 * size shows the desktop fitted whole into it, centred, with black bars
 * (D01).
 *
 * The choice is kept in ~/.config/keiland/displays.conf (D-STORE), key=value
 * lines:
 *
 *   version=1
 *   mode=extended | mirror
 *   anchor=KEY                the display the desktop is anchored on (mirror)
 *   place=KEY X Y             a display's place in the extended mode (the
 *                             key may hold spaces; X and Y are the last
 *                             two words)
 *   brightness=N              the built-in panel's light, 0 to 100 (ws113-p005)
 *   off=KEY                   a display the user turned off in the extended mode
 *                             (ws113-p014; the mirror shows it still, and it is
 *                             shown when no other display is connected)
 *
 * KEY is a display's persistent connector key (D-ID A2, the display's name,
 * "zedbsd-port-v1:pci:0000:00:02.0:hdmi:B").  Lines of other keys are left
 * for later versions; a file of another version is not read.
 *
 * Nothing here knows the server or Vulkan, so the host tests run it alone.
