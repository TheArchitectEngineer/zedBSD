 * A lane: resident threads of the compositor that run jobs the main thread
 * gives them, away from the event loop, and hand them back.
 *
 * A job's run is called on a thread of the lane and may wait (a device's
 * open, a file's write and fsync); its done is called on the main thread
 * from kwl_lane_take, which the event loop calls after its wake pipe, and
 * applies the result.  A lane of one thread runs its jobs in the order
 * given; a lane of more threads (a pool) runs as many at once.  A job with
 * a key replaces the job of the same key that has not started yet: the
 * replaced one comes back to the main thread canceled (its drop is called,
 * not its done), so only the latest of a kind is run.
 *
 * The lane writes one byte to the main thread's wake pipe when its
 * finished jobs go from none to some; the main thread takes all of them.
