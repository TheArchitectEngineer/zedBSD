/*
 * The input thread (input-thread.c, ws213-p004; the design is
 * plan/ws213/phase001/phase.md 6.1).
 *
 * The input thread reads the evdev devices, assembles their reports in
 * the order they were made (BUG-142), runs the touch pads' layer and the
 * mouse's acceleration, and writes the pointer's place into the cursor's
 * box (cursor-box.h) as each report comes, whatever the main thread is
 * doing.  Every report then goes to the main thread through one ordered
 * queue, which applies it as before: the clients' events, the hover, the
 * shell's gestures.  The input thread never calls Vulkan, the backend's
 * seat or the server's state.
 *
 * The main thread owns the devices' opening and closing.  It hands a
 * device's descriptor to the input thread with an attach command and takes
 * it back with a detach, which waits until the input thread has stopped
 * using the descriptor; only then is the descriptor closed or given back
 * to the seat, so a descriptor number reused by another file is never read
 * as a device (design 6.1 N-1).
