 * Bluetooth on Linux (ws143-p007, plan/ws143/phase007/phase.md section 9):
 * BlueZ's org.bluez on the system bus, behind the backend's Bluetooth
 * calls (keiland-backend.h).
 *
 * One connection of its own, opened and authenticated before anything
 * else and never waited on after that: every call goes out with
 * dbus_send_call() and its answer comes back through the dispatch, where
 * the table of calls sent says what it answers.  The signals of org.bluez
 * (objects added and removed, properties changed) and the bus's word on
 * who owns org.bluez keep the adapter and the devices current; the
 * adapter's properties are read again every two seconds while someone
 * watches, otherwise every thirty.  The connection exports the agent
 * that answers BlueZ's pairing questions (DisplayYesNo), asked of the
 * user through the backend's questions.
 *
 * A lost connection is opened again after a wait that doubles up to
 * thirty seconds; a lost or replaced org.bluez ends the request and the
 * question outstanding and empties the tables.
