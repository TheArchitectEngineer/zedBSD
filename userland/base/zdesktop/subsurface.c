 * wl_subcompositor and wl_subsurface (ws035-p077): the video, GL parts and
 * client-side decorations a toolkit draws on surfaces of their own.
 *
 * A sub-surface is shown with its parent (a window, a popup, or another
 * sub-surface), at a position relative to the parent's image, below or
 * above it; its own children go with it.  The position set is applied when
 * the parent's state is applied.  A synchronized sub-surface (the default,
 * and every sub-surface under a synchronized one) keeps its commit in a
 * cache until then; a desynchronized one shows its commit at once.
 *
 * The stacking requests (place_above, place_below) are applied at once,
 * not with the parent's next commit, and a sub-surface's whole image takes
 * the pointer (input regions are not kept).
