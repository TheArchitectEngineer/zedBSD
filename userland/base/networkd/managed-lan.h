 * Declares networkd's wired interface policy.
 *
 * What to do with a wired interface follows from two things: whether a
 * cable is in it, and what the configuration says it should be.  The first
 * is told to the daemon by the kernel, as a carrier change on the route
 * socket; the second is handed over by the net command, which owns the
 * file it is written in.  This holds both, and says what to do next.
 *
 * Nothing here opens a device or runs a command.  Deciding and doing are
 * kept apart so that the deciding can be read, and tested, on its own.
