 * Estimates file space usage (POSIX XCU du).
 *
 *	du [-a|-s] [-kx] [-H|-L] [file...]
 *
 * For each file operand (default ".") du writes the space allocated to it:
 * to a directory, the space of the whole hierarchy under it.  Each
 * directory in the hierarchy is written after what is below it; -a writes
 * every other file too, and -s only the operands.  The space is in
 * 512-byte units, or 1024-byte units with -k, rounded up.
 *
 * A file reached more than once, through hard links or through symbolic
 * links that are followed, is counted and written the first time only,
 * for all the operands together.  -x stays on the file system of each
 * operand.  Symbolic links are not followed, except those on the command
 * line with -H and all of them with -L; a directory met again inside
 * itself is reported as a loop.
 *
 * The output is "%d %s\n" with a tab as the blank, as other systems write
 * it.  du exits with 0, or 1 when some file could not be examined.
