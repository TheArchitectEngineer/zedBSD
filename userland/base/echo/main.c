 * Writes its arguments (POSIX XCU echo): the shell's echo builtin as a command of its own.
 * The builtin and the command are the same source
 * (userland/base/sh/printf.c), so they behave alike.
 *
 * As a command it also takes GNU's options, as /bin/echo does on GNU
 * systems (scripts run it with env or exec to get them): leading words made
 * of the letters n, e and E only.  -n leaves out the newline, -e keeps the
 * escapes (which the XSI echo interprets anyway) and -E writes the
 * operands as they are.  With POSIXLY_CORRECT set, only the builtin's -n
 * is an option.
