 * Copies files and file hierarchies for cp, and for mv across file systems.
 *
 * A regular file is copied by content into a destination that is opened
 * and truncated, or created with the source's permission bits; with -f a
 * destination that cannot be opened is removed and created again.  With
 * -R a directory is copied entry by entry into a directory that is made
 * owner-writable while it is filled and given its final permissions after,
 * and symbolic links, FIFOs and devices are made anew rather than read.
 * Which symbolic links are followed is the -H, -L or -P policy.
 *
 * With -p the owner, the permission bits and the access and modification
 * times are duplicated after the content; an owner that cannot be given
 * clears the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits instead of failing.  With
 * -a, names that share one source file share one copy.  An optional report
 * file receives one hex-encoded record for each completed entry, which the
 * installer uses to account for a tree copy.
