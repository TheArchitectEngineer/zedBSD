 * The update of libpdf's writer: a new revision added to a document being
 * read, as Notes saves its drawing on another program's PDF
 * (plan/ws079/design-pdf.md section 3).
 *
 * The file an update saves is the document's bytes, unchanged, followed by
 * the revision: the objects the revision changes, written again under their
 * own numbers, the objects it adds, a cross-reference section that lists
 * only those, and a trailer that links the document's newest section by
 * /Prev.  Every page of the document is listed once, in order: kept as it
 * is, drawn over (the page's own content streams follow one that saves the
 * graphics state, and the new content restores it before it draws, so
 * whatever state the page's content leaves does not reach the drawing; the
 * page's resources gain the new ones), or drawn anew in place of the
 * page's own content.  Pages the writer adds between them go into the page
 * tree next to their neighbours.  The attached file replaces any earlier
 * one of its name in the catalog's EmbeddedFiles name tree and associated
 * files, and the information dictionary gets the date of the save.
 *
 * The new content's resources are named with the prefix "Kei", so they do
 * not meet the names the page's own content uses.  Objects of the document
 * that the revision copies are written back as the reader read them:
 * references stay references and strings are written in hexadecimal.
