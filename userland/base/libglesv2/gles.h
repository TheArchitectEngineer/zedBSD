/*
 * The inside of zedBSD's OpenGL ES 2.0 (WS068 p008): the objects and the
 * state of a context, and the translation of both into Vulkan.
 *
 * Every GL object keeps its contents on the CPU (a buffer's bytes, a
 * texture's levels as RGBA8) and a device copy that a draw brings up to
 * date when the CPU copy changed.  A device copy that a draw of the
 * frame being recorded already uses is never written again: a new one is
 * made and the old one waits in the garbage until the frame is done.
 *
 * Shaders are GLSL (compiled by glsl/, WS068 p015-p019, into SPIR-V when
 * the program links) or SPIR-V (glShaderBinary with
 * GL_SHADER_BINARY_FORMAT_SPIR_V), both in the form
 * plan/ws068/phase008/phase.md gives: the uniforms other than
 * samplers in one uniform block at set 0 binding 0, the samplers at set 0
 * from binding 1, the named uniform blocks of OpenGL ES 3 (WS068 p024,
 * read from buffer objects) at set 0 from binding 32, attributes and
 * varyings by location.  Linking reads the
 * names and locations out of the SPIR-V and rewrites the vertex shader so
 * that its gl_Position becomes Vulkan's (y turned over, z from [-w, w] to
 * [0, w]).
