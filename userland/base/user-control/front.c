 * value is passed as it was given; account-admin alone judges it by its
 * rules, so the terminal and Settings never disagree.  This side refuses
 * only what would break the form: a value holding a line break, which
 * would read as another key, and a request longer than account-admin
 * takes.
 *
 * account-admin runs as a child with the request on its standard input.
 * Its one answer line on standard output, "ok" or "error REASON", is
 * turned into a message on standard error and an exit status
 * (docs/reference/user-administration.md, "Exit status").  The environment
 * passes through, so that account-admin can log the user who ran sudo.
