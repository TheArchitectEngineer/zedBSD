 * Atoms, window properties and selections, and the bridge between X's
 * CLIPBOARD and the desktop's clipboard (ws035-p087).
 *
 * Atoms: the core predefined atoms the clients use keep their numbers;
 * any other name is given the next number.  Properties: any property a
 * client sets on a window is kept (WM_NAME and the icon path are also kept
 * as the window's strings, protocol.c).  Selections: a selection's owner is
 * a client's window, told SelectionClear when another takes it; a
 * ConvertSelection is passed to the owner as SelectionRequest, and the
 * owner answers the requestor through SendEvent (SelectionNotify), as the
 * ICCCM has it.
 *
 * The bridge: when another desktop client's text becomes the desktop's
 * selection, the server owns CLIPBOARD for it (on the root window) and
 * answers a ConvertSelection itself, with the text read from the desktop
 * (and PRIMARY, when no X client owns it).  While an X client owns
 * CLIPBOARD the server offers its text to the desktop; a desktop client
 * asking for it hands over a descriptor, and the server asks the owner
 * for UTF8_STRING into a property of the root window, then writes what the
 * owner put there into the descriptor.
 *
 * PRIMARY is bridged the same way with the desktop's primary selection
 * (ws035-p103); without an X owner and without the desktop's primary text,
 * PRIMARY still answers with the clipboard's text, as before.
