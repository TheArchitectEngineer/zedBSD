/*
 * The kernel is linked at one fixed virtual address (platform/amd64/vmunix.ld)
 * inside the one-GiB bootstrap window that the loader and the HAL both map at
 * AMD64_KERNEL_LINK_VIRT_BASE.  The physical address it is linked for is only
 * the preferred placement: a loader may put the image at any other physical
 * address that satisfies AMD64_KERNEL_PHYS_ALIGN/LIMIT and must report the
 * actual placement through kernel_phys_start/kernel_phys_end of the handoff.
 * The HAL maps the linked virtual range onto the reported physical range, so
 *
 *     physical = virtual - AMD64_KERNEL_LINK_VIRT_BASE
 *                        - AMD64_KERNEL_LINK_PHYS_START + kernel_phys_start
 *
 * holds for every image address.  With the linked placement the expression
 * degenerates to the historical identity window.
 *
 * The bootstrap window doubles as the early physical-memory window (VGA text,
 * the handoff block, early page-table pages).  Behind a relocated image the
 * linked physical range has no window address any more: the HAL reserves it
 * ("shadow") so that nothing is ever handed out there before the direct map.
