/*
 * The backend face of the generic /dev/graphics front end.
 *
 * The front end (src/drivers/generic/graphics-device.c) owns the device
 * node, the single open, the user copies, and the splitting of a user row
 * into chunks that fit its kernel buffers. A backend only draws: it gets
 * already-validated rectangles and rows of at most a few thousand pixels.
 *
 * Several backends may register during boot; the one with the highest
 * priority is chosen once, when the front end registers /dev/graphics.
 * A firmware framebuffer registers with DRV_GRAPHICS_PRIORITY_FIRMWARE,
 * the lowest. A later card driver takes the display over this way:
 *
 *   1. It matches only display nodes the loader enumerated (no kernel PCI
 *      scan), using the platform's named handoff values.
 *   2. During boot, before /dev/graphics is registered, it calls
 *      drv_graphics_backend_register() with a higher priority.
 *   3. It moves the text console to its own surface by calling
 *      kern_text_register() again (a second call replaces the first).
 *   4. The firmware mapping is no longer used after that; its window is
 *      not returned.
 *
 * Takeover happens only at boot, so nothing here waits for graphics to be
 * left before a backend changes.
