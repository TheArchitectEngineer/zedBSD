 * sandbox_spawn (ws168-p002; plan/ws168/phase001 section 3).
 *
 * The parent asks for a child that runs a static image in a sandbox from
 * its first instruction: a new address space, only the files the request
 * maps (the parent's descriptor from, as the child's number to), no root
 * and no working directory, the caller's credentials without the image's
 * set-ID bits, default signals, the smaller of the parent's limits and
 * the request's, and only the system calls of the base set and the
 * allow bits.  A call outside the set ends the child with SIGKILL (or
 * answers EPERM with SANDBOX_SPAWN_DENY_ERRNO, for tests).
 *
 * The request is versioned by its size: a kernel that knows a larger
 * structure takes a smaller one of at least the first version, and a
 * kernel that knows a smaller one takes a larger one only when the bytes
 * it does not know are all zero (E2BIG otherwise).  An unknown flag or
 * allow bit is refused (EINVAL): an old kernel never runs a child in a
 * weaker sandbox than asked.
