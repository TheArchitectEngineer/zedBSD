 * PLDA PCIe root complex, as the StarFive JH7110 has two of.
 *
 * Each root complex has a register block, a configuration window the
 * driver opens with an address translation entry, and memory windows the
 * device tree's ranges describe.  The four legacy pins and the root
 * complex's own events share one interrupt line: the driver reads the
 * status, runs the pins' lines through the PCI core's pin hooks, and
 * acknowledges.  What lies outside the block -- the reset line PERST#, the
 * link state and the selection of the root port's function -- belongs to
 * the board, which hands the driver its operations.
