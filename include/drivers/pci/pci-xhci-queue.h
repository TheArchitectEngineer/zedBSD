 * PCI xHCI bulk endpoint request queue decisions
 *
 * A bulk endpoint whose class driver asked for it keeps several transfer
 * descriptors (TDs) on its ring at once.  The controller runs the TDs of a
 * ring in order (xHCI 1.2 section 4.9.2), so the requests form a FIFO in
 * the order they were put on the ring: the head is the TD the controller
 * works on, and an event names the head unless it is a late event of a TD
 * that has already been retired.  These helpers hold no lock and touch no
 * hardware; the controller driver calls them under its own lock.
