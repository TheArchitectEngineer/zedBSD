 * The raw HID devices' class (ws161-p002; the node's interface is
 * <uapi/hidraw.h>).
 *
 * A transport (usb-hid, or the test kernel's loopback authenticator)
 * registers a raw device with what it is and one operation, the sending of
 * an output report, and hands every input report it receives to
 * drv_hidraw_input().  The class publishes hidrawN (devfs shows it as
 * /dev/input/hidrawN), keeps a queue for each open, and answers the
 * requests.  drv_hidraw_unregister() takes the transport away: no output
 * runs after it returns, and the files still open answer ENODEV.
