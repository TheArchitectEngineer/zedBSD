 * Read-only access to a flattened device tree.

 * The firmware of a board without ACPI describes its devices in a flattened
 * device tree, and the HAL hands its physical address to the kernel.  These
 * calls let a driver find the node of its device and read the addresses,
 * windows and interrupts the node describes.  Nothing is copied or cached:
 * every call walks the blob, which stays owned by whoever mapped it.
 *
 * A node is named by the offset of its begin-node token from the start of
 * the blob.  The root node's offset is never zero, so zero means "no node".
