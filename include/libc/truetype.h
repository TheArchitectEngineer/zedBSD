/*
 * Reading a TrueType font and drawing its glyphs.
 *
 * This reads the tables a screen needs and no more: the character map, the
 * outlines, and the advance widths.  Hinting, kerning and layout are not
 * here; what is here is enough to put readable text on a display.  Colour
 * glyphs are found as the PNG images a colour emoji font stores
 * (truetype_color_glyph); decoding them is the caller's.
 *
 * A face is opened over memory the caller owns and keeps.  Nothing is copied
 * out of the file, so the memory must outlive the face.
 *
 * Sizes are in pixels per em.  A glyph is rendered into a caller-owned
 * 8-bit coverage bitmap: 0 is background and 255 is the glyph, with the
 * values between naming how much of the pixel the outline covers.  Whoever
 * draws decides what those mean in colour.
