/*
 * Tells QEMU's raspi4b from a Raspberry Pi 4 by the device tree it hands
 * over (T1-554).
 *
 * QEMU loads the vendor's tree given with -dtb and, before it passes the
 * tree to the kernel, removes the nodes of the devices it does not emulate:
 * every node compatible with "brcm,bcm2711-pcie", "brcm,bcm2711-rng200",
 * "brcm,bcm2711-thermal" or "brcm,bcm2711-genet-v5" is overwritten with NOP
 * tokens (raspi4_modify_dtb() in QEMU's hw/arm/raspi4b.c).  It does not mark
 * them disabled: the nodes are gone.
 *
 * A board's firmware hands over the same vendor tree with its own additions:
 * the command line and the board's serial and revision, the memory it
 * found, the dtparam and overlay settings.  Those add properties and nodes
 * or change a status; none removes a node.  Every Pi 4 model's tree (4 B,
 * 400, CM4, CM4S, in the firmware and in Linux) describes both the PCIe
 * controller and the GENET Ethernet.
 *
 * So a BCM2711 tree in which neither the PCIe controller nor the GENET node
 * exists at all, whatever their status would have been, is QEMU's.  Both
 * are required, so that one node missing from an unusual board tree is not
 * taken for the emulator.
