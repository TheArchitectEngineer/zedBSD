 * The power of PCI functions across S0 idle (ws052-p004).
 *
 * drv_pci_suspend_all() suspends every function a driver is bound to,
 * the functions behind a bridge before the bridge's own bus: the driver's
 * suspend stops the function, the configuration is saved, the function
 * goes to D3hot through its power management capability, and the
 * platform (ACPI: _PS3, power resources) follows.  A driver that wants
 * the function to wake the system asks for it with drv_pci_device_set_wake()
 * from its suspend; PME_En is set and the platform arms the wake.  If any
 * step fails, every function suspended so far is resumed again, in the
 * reverse order, and the function that failed is reported: S0 idle is
 * abandoned rather than entered with a device still running.  A bound
 * driver without a suspend cannot be suspended and fails the same way.
 *
 * drv_pci_resume_all() undoes it in the reverse order: the platform
 * powers the function, D0, the configuration written back, the wake
 * disarmed, and the driver's resume.  A driver whose resume reports
 * ESTALE says its function lost the state it had and can be attached
 * afresh; the function is detached and attached again.
 *
 * Functions without a driver are left alone.  The two calls come from the
 * one thread that enters and leaves S0 idle; a second suspend before the
 * resume is refused.
