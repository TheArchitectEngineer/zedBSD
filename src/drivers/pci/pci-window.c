/*
 * The placement of a BAR the firmware left unassigned (BUG-210).
 *
 * The firmware of some machines (the Latitude 5330's, for its LPSS I2C
 * controllers) leaves a memory BAR at address 0 for the operating system
 * to place, as Linux's PCI core does.  A BAR is placed inside a window the
 * host bridge's _CRS gives its bus, at the lowest address aligned to its
 * size that no busy range touches: the other functions' BARs, the bridges'
 * windows, the motherboard's reserved ranges, the configuration space and
 * the firmware's memory map.  A BAR that can take a 64-bit address tries
 * the windows above 4 GiB first, where no hidden device of the chipset
 * lives; a 32-bit BAR uses only the part of a window below 4 GiB.  The
 * windows below 1 MiB (the legacy VGA and option ROM ranges) are never
 * used.
 *
 * Nothing here touches hardware, so the host test compiles this file as
 * it is (plan/ws159/tests/run-host-pci-window.sh).
