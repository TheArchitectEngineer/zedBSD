/*
 * The uvc driver's stream: the PROBE/COMMIT negotiation, the transfers,
 * the worker and the halt.
 *
 * A mode is asked for with SET_CUR(PROBE) and read back with
 * GET_CUR(PROBE); the answer is corrected and, for SET_FORMAT, sent back
 * with SET_CUR(COMMIT).  Every start commits the saved answer again, so
 * whatever another open's TRY_FORMAT or a stop left on the device, the
 * stream runs in the mode its owner set.
 *
 * An isochronous stream selects the smallest alternate the host takes
 * whose capacity holds the committed payload, and refuses with ENOSPC
 * when there is none: the device sets the pace, and a smaller alternate
 * would only lose data.  It keeps four transfers of 32 packets on the
 * endpoint; a bulk stream keeps one transfer.  The transfers' callbacks
 * only mark their transfer done and wake the worker.  The worker takes
 * the transfers strictly in the order they were submitted, a ring, so a
 * late wake that finds several done never reads a newer one before an
 * older one.  It hands each payload to the assembler and submits the
 * transfer again.
 *
 * The worker also watches the stream.  A frame missing for long is
 * counted as no signal and is not a fault; transfers that stop finishing
 * altogether are, as is a disconnected device.
 *
 * The halt sets stopping, waits out a submission under way, cancels and
 * drains the transfers, joins the worker and selects alternate 0.  It is
 * harmless when nothing runs.  A transfer that does not drain keeps its
 * buffer and is tried again by the next halt.
