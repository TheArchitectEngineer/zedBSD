/*
 * The ACPI side of S0 idle (ws052-p003): the LPS0 device's notifications
 * and the device power helpers that the suspend of the devices uses.
 *
 * The LPS0 device (_HID INT33A1, or PNP0D80 as an identifier) is told
 * through its _DSM that the displays went off and that the platform
 * enters its low-power idle, and the reverse on the way back.  Two _DSM
 * families exist, Intel's and Microsoft's; firmware implements either or
 * both, and function 0 of each says which of its functions exist.  The
 * Microsoft family adds the modern standby entry and exit around the
 * low-power entry and exit.
 *
 * A device's power goes through _PS0 to _PS3 and the power resources its
 * _PR0 to _PR3 name.  A power resource is shared among devices: it is
 * turned on (_ON) when the first device needs it and off (_OFF) when the
 * last one lets it go.  A device's wake goes through _PRW (its GPE and the
 * power resources the wake needs) and _DSW, or the older _PSW.
 *
 * Each public function holds the interpreter while it runs, and the
 * tables below change only with it held.  A method that sleeps (Sleep)
 * lets the interpreter go meanwhile; the S0 idle path calls these from its
 * one thread, which is what keeps one device's transitions in order.
