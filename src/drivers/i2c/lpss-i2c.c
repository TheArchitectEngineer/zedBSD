/*
 * The I2C controllers of the Intel PCH's low power subsystem (LPSS), which
 * are Synopsys DesignWare APB I2C cores behind a PCI function (ws159-p002).
 *
 * The function is brought to D0, its private reset register lets the core
 * out of reset, and the core is checked by its component type.  It is then
 * an I2C master in fast mode (400 kHz) or standard mode (100 kHz), whose
 * SCL counts come from the input clock (LPSS_CLOCK_KHZ: the Alder Lake
 * PCH's 133 MHz).  A transfer runs without the controller's interrupt: the
 * commands go into the transmit FIFO, the bytes read come out of the
 * receive FIFO, and the thread sleeps a tick whenever neither moved.  A
 * 64-byte read at 400 kHz takes about 1.6 ms, so a transfer sleeps a tick
 * or two rather than spinning.  The bus is registered with the I2C
 * registry (i2c.c), where the I2C-HID driver finds it by its ACPI path.
