/*
 * Intel AX211 private API89 scan-session coordinator.
 *
 * Sources of the values.  The register offsets, bit positions, command
 * numbers, firmware file record types and wire layouts in this file are facts
 * of the AX211 hardware and of its firmware interface.  Intel publishes no
 * register or host-command specification for this device, so the values were
 * collected with Intel's own driver headers as the primary source: Linux
 * iwlwifi at tag v6.17, under drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/, in
 * fw/api/scan.h.  They were cross-checked against OpenBSD
 * sys/dev/pci/if_iwxreg.h and if_iwx.c at commit 0f464d413c50.  Each block of
 * values below names the header it was taken from.
 *
 * This file is not an adaptation of those headers.  It collects the interface
 * values, gives them names of its own, and adds what the zedBSD driver
 * established about each of them while it was brought up on AX211 hardware:
 * where the value is used, what it means to the device or to the firmware,
 * the order the device requires, and how the firmware behaved.  It is written
 * as a reference that a developer of an AX211 driver for another operating
 * system can use on its own.
