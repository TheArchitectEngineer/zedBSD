 * values below names the header it was taken from.
 *
 * This file is not an adaptation of those headers.  It collects the interface

 * established about each of them while it was brought up on AX211 hardware:
 * where the value is used, what it means to the device or to the firmware,
 * the order the device requires, and how the firmware behaved.  It is written

 * The boot context: the one structure the device reads to find the host's
 * rings when the firmware starts.

 * iwl_context_info_v2, and OpenBSD sys/dev/pci/if_iwxreg.h, struct
 * iwx_context_info_gen3, at commit 0f464d413c50.  The field order and widths
 * are the device's DMA layout; the names here are zedBSD's.
 *
 * drv_intel_ax211_boot_context_encode() writes these fields as 104
 * little-endian bytes into a coherent DMA page, and the address of that page
 * goes into the boot context register before the upper CPU is started.  The
 * device reads the page when the firmware starts and then works from the
 * rings it names.  drv_intel_ax211_dma_prepare_boot() writes a new page for
 * every boot attempt instead of reusing an old one.  Byte offsets on the
 * wire, in field order: version 0, (a 16-bit length in words, always 26,
 * written by the encoder at 2), config 4, status page 8, the four index
 * arrays 16, 24, 32 and 40, the two index slot counts 48 and 50, the two
 * ring addresses 52 and 60, the two size codes 68 and 70, the doorbells 72
 * and 74, the vectors 76 and 78, the four entry header and footer sizes 80
 * to 83, the ring control flags 84, the status page vector 86, the scratch
 * area address 88 and its size 96; bytes 100 to 103 are reserved and zero.
 *
 * How the fields are used on the AX211, as found by this driver:
 * - version and config are zero; the API 89 firmware boots with them so.
 * - status_page_address is a 4 KiB page the firmware owns for its own
 *   bookkeeping.  The driver puts the two tail-index arrays inside it, at
 *   2048 and 3072 bytes from its start (half and three quarters of the page,
 *   the places Linux uses as well).
 * - completion_head_array_address is a two-byte DMA word in which the device
 *   publishes how far it has filled the receive completion ring.  The
 *   transport reads it as a little-endian 16-bit index to learn which
 *   completions are new.
 * - transfer_head_array_address and the two index slot counts stay zero: this
 *   driver uses no per-queue head array.
 * - command_ring_address is the command TFD ring and response_ring_address
 *   is the receive completion ring; command responses and notifications all
 *   arrive through receive completions.
 * - the size codes must be 5 for the 256-entry command ring and 9 for the
 *   512-entry receive ring, and the encoder refuses any other value.
 * - doorbells, vectors, entry header and footer sizes, ring control flags and
 *   the status page vector are zero.  The API 89 firmware boots with them so,
 *   and every interrupt then arrives on MSI-X vector 0, the only vector the
 *   transport routes.
 * - scratch_area_address and scratch_area_size name the 1660-byte scratch
 *   area in which the driver tells the firmware where the PNVM sections, the
 *   receive buffers and the firmware's own DRAM copies are.
