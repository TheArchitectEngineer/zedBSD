/*
 * The sizes of the DMA areas prepared for one boot.
 *
 * - The scratch area is 1660 bytes; the firmware is told its size in words
 *   at its byte 4 (415).
 * - The status page is one 4 KiB page owned by the firmware; the transmit
 *   and completion tail arrays live inside it (intel-ax211-internal.h).
 * - The interrupt cause table (4 KiB, 4 KiB aligned) is allocated but never
 *   given to the device: the table is the legacy interrupt path, and this
 *   driver runs in MSI-X mode only.
 * - The command ring, its byte-count table, its slots and the external
 *   command buffer, and the two receive rings, have the sizes given in
 *   intel-ax211-transport.c.  The device's completion index is one 16-bit
 *   word, and each receive buffer is 4 KiB, which the scratch area's
 *   control flags announce.
 * - The PNVM address table holds the 64-bit address of each PNVM section
 *   copied for the running board, at most 64 entries in 512 bytes.
 * - The image loader is the 13944-byte loader record of the pinned image,
 *   and no runtime section of that image exceeds 32 KiB, which the loader
 *   checks before it copies one into DMA memory.
 *
 * Values referenced: Linux v6.17
 * drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/pcie/iwl-context-info-v2.h (the scratch
 * area, struct iwl_prph_scratch, and the status page),
 * drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/iwl-fh.h (rings and the 4 KiB receive
 * buffers) and drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/fw/file.h (the image loader
 * record).
