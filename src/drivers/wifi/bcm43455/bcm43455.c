/*
 * BCM43455: the device's lifecycle, its start and stop, and its network
 * device.
 *
 * The board's driver makes the device with the files it read, probes it
 * once (start without the radio, learn the identity, stop) and publishes
 * it as wlanN with a WLAN station.  Opening the interface starts the chip
 * again, with the radio up and the bus thread serving it; closing it
 * stops the thread, takes the radio down and cuts the chip's power.
 *
 * Every start makes the same settings: receive glomming off, the CLM
 * loaded, the country set to the world-wide "XX" and read back, roaming
 * off, power saving off, the events the driver uses enabled.
 *
 * The station is attached with the FullMAC radio operations of
 * bcm43455-station.c, which use the WLAN core's FullMAC engine: the bus
 * hooks here hand events, received frames, the radio work and a bus
 * failure to them, and the poll lets them report.
