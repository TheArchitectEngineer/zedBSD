 * BCM43455: the three files the chip is given, and what is done with them.
 *
 * The package bcm43455-firmware installs the firmware, the regulatory
 * table (CLM) and the board's NVRAM settings under /lib/firmware with
 * their upstream names.  The driver reads them whole, checks their size
 * and form, turns the NVRAM text into the chip's form, and sends the CLM
 * to the running firmware in pieces.  It never changes the files.  Only
 * bcm43455_files_load() touches the file system; everything else here is
 * a pure function.
