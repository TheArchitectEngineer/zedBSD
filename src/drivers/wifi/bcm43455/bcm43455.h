 * BCM43455 (Broadcom/Cypress) FullMAC Wi-Fi over SDIO.
 *
 * The driver loads the chip's firmware, its regulatory table and the
 * board's NVRAM settings, talks to the running firmware in SDPCM frames
 * carrying BCDC messages, and publishes the chip as a wlanN network
 * device with a WLAN station.  It reaches the chip only through the bus
 * operations below, which the board's SDIO host provides (Raspberry Pi
 * 4: src/drivers/platform/rpi4/rpi4-wifi.c) and a host test replaces.

 * What the driver needs of the SDIO bus.
 *
 * Every operation runs in thread context.  read_byte and write_byte are
 * CMD52; read and write are CMD53, with an incrementing address (the
 * backplane) or a fixed one (increment 0: the frame function's FIFO), a
 * length up to the function's block size in byte mode and a longer one in
 * whole blocks.  sleep waits without busy waiting and returns ECANCELED when
 * the board stops the driver.  interrupt_wait waits for the card's
 * interrupt until deadline (the scheduler's clock): 0 for an interrupt,
 * which leaves it disarmed until interrupt_rearm; EAGAIN for a wakeup
 * from interrupt_kick; ETIMEDOUT at the deadline.  power_up resets the
 * chip through its power line and enumerates its SDIO interface up to
 * function 1 enabled and both block sizes set; power_down cuts the
 * chip's power.
