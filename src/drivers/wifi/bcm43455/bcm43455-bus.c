/*
 * BCM43455: the bus thread, the receive path and control requests.
 *
 * One routine, service(), reads the SDIO core's interrupt status, answers
 * the firmware's mailbox and reads every pending frame; the bus thread
 * runs it after each interrupt and every 100 ms, and a direct-mode
 * request runs it while it waits for its answer.  Frames go out only
 * within the credit the firmware grants in every frame it sends.
 *
 * Every buffer a request or an answer passes through (the slot, the frame
 * buffers) is cleared once its bytes have moved on, so a key that a
 * request carries does not stay in memory.
 *
 * Sources: the receive and send rules (a twelve-byte header read first,
 * the rest in four-byte units; the credit window; the first sequence
 * number; the padding; the interrupt status and mailbox handling) follow
 * OpenBSD's bwfm(4) (ISC), sys/dev/sdmmc/if_bwfm_sdio.c 1.44
 * (bwfm_sdio_rx_frames(), bwfm_sdio_tx_ok(), bwfm_sdio_tx_ctrlframe(),
 * bwfm_sdio_task()); the abort of a bad frame follows Infineon's WHD
 * (Apache-2.0), whd_bus_sdio_protocol.c (whd_bus_sdio_abort_read()).  The
 * thread, the slot, direct mode and the hooks are this driver's own.
