 * BCM43455: the SDPCM framing of the chip's frame function (SDIO F2).
 *
 * Every frame between the host and the chip's firmware starts with a
 * four-byte frame tag (the frame's length and its complement) and an
 * eight-byte software header: a sequence number, the channel the frame
 * belongs to, where its payload starts, and the firmware's flow control
 * and transmit credit.  The functions here only encode and decode; they
 * touch no hardware.
