 * /dev/input-inject: a test-only pen, touch screen, touch pad, mouse or
 * keyboard for machines without one (QEMU), or driven by an agent over SSH
 * on a real one (AAT, ws173).
 *
 * Only root may open the node, and at most INPUT_INJECT_OPENS_MAX opens at
 * a time, each its own device.  The first write declares the device
 * (include/uapi/input-inject.h): one of the fixed shapes, so no other
 * device type can be made.  A mouse and a keyboard take checked events like
 * a pen, and reach readers like a USB mouse and keyboard.
 * For a pen, later writes pass checked events to the ordinary input layer.
 * For a touch screen, later writes are frames of fingers, which are split
 * into the reports a USB touch screen sends and run through the USB touch
 * screen's state machine (src/drivers/usb/hid-touch.c).  A touch screen may
 * be declared with a Scan Time, which its frames then carry.  Either way the
 * device reaches readers as /dev/input/eventN like a USB one.  Closing
 * removes it.
