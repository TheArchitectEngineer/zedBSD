 * A check, on the running firmware, of whether the processor's cached
 * view of memory sees what the core's firmware processor writes.
 *
 * The driver shares memory with the core as if the core did not snoop
 * the processor's caches; this check only reports what it sees and
 * changes nothing.  It names the path it tries: stores of the firmware's
 * MIPS processor, through its page table, with the page uncached on the
 * MIPS side, and nothing done about the core's system level cache.  What
 * the core's data masters do is another path.
 *
 * Procedure referenced:
 * plan/ws256/design-peripherals.md section 2.4 (controls 0b, 1 and 6:
 * a clean line loaded before the device writes, eight rounds of 64 KiB
 * across 2 MiB, the verdict taken from the cached view only, and the
 * range dropped from the caches afterwards).
