/*
 * The Imagination PowerVR Rogue GPU core: the early stage of its attach.
 *
 * The early stage runs while the board brings its devices up, before the
 * root file system is mounted.  It powers the core through the SoC's
 * glue, reads the core's identity (branch, version, number of scalable
 * units, configuration) and keeps the core only when it is the BXE-4-32
 * whose firmware the system carries.  It also checks, once, that the
 * uncached view of memory the firmware's shared structures will live in
 * shows the same memory as the cached one; the later stage that loads
 * the firmware relies on that.
 *
 * Every outcome is one short line of the boot log, which the board's
 * screen shows.
