/*
 * The machine encoding of the PowerVR Rogue programmable data sequencer.
 *
 * The data sequencer runs a short program per task before the shading
 * cluster starts: it loads constants into the cluster's stores and then
 * issues the cluster task.  Each instruction is one 32-bit word; the
 * issue instructions take 64-bit and 32-bit data words the driver
 * places in the program's constants, built by the helpers here.
 *
 * Operands are register numbers in the ranges each instruction
 * accepts: 32-bit constants 0 to 127, temporaries from 128 and
 * persistent temporaries from 192 in the 32-bit space; 64-bit constants
 * 0 to 63, temporaries from 64 and persistent ones from 96 in the
 * 64-bit space.  The narrower temporary-only fields count from zero.
 *
 * The PowerVR BXE-4-32 has the double-rate DMA test fields and no
 * system level cache controls in the DMA source word, so the encoder
 * offers the former and never sets the latter.
