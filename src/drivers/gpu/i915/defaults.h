/*
 * Recording each engine's default context image (__engines_record_defaults()).
 *
 * The reference, per engine:
 *
 *   intel_context_create(engine)     a 4 KiB ring and a new timeline with its
 *                                    own 4 KiB status page; the timeline has
 *                                    an initial breadcrumb, so its seqnos
 *                                    advance by 2
 *   intel_renderstate_init()         pins the context: the image is built with
 *                                    the restore inhibited; no render state
 *                                    on Gen12
 *   i915_request_create()            the invalidate flush
 *   intel_engine_emit_ctx_wa()       the context workarounds
 *   i915_request_add()               the breadcrumb, then the submission
 *
 * then intel_gt_wait_for_idle(gt, I915_GEM_IDLE_TIMEOUT): each request
 * retires once its seqno lands, the engine parks, and the park switches to
 * the kernel context -- a request on the pinned kernel context -- unless the
 * engine's wakeref serial has caught up with its serial.  The record context
 * is switched out and its image written back; only when that second request
 * has retired is the engine idle.  Then a CSB error fails the recording with
 * EIO, and otherwise the record context's whole image becomes the engine's
 * default state.  Any error wedges the GT, which resets the engines.
 *
 * Because the restore was inhibited, the engine does not load the record
 * context: it runs from its post-reset register state and saves that into
 * the image on switch-out.  That saved image is the default state.
 *
 * Two things differ from the reference.  The wait polls the CSB and the
 * status pages (what intel_engine_flush_submission() does inline on the wait
 * path) for at least the timeout of real time, instead of a retire worker.
 * And the park switch is submitted after the record context has completed in
 * the CSB, not merely after its seqno landed, because one request is in
 * flight per engine; the commands submitted are the same.
