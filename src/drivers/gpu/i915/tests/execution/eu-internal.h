 * The compute test owns the request path every test submits through: one
 * execbuf-shaped request on a fresh context of the GT address space
 * (i915_request_create, gen8_emit_init_breadcrumb, gen8_emit_bb_start,
 * i915_request_add), a bounded wait for it to retire, the switch back to the
 * kernel context, and the dump and engine reset after a hang.  The draw tests
 * and the full-HD draw reuse that path through the functions declared here.
