/*
 * The fixed 3D draws the hardware tests submit.
 *
 * Each fixture is a state page (surface heap, dynamic heap, pixel shader,
 * vertices and markers) and a batch that names it by GPU address only, so a
 * test can submit the same command list and state bytes on any context of the
 * GT's address space.  Nothing here touches the hardware.
 *
 * The single-colour draw is a RECTLIST over a 32x32 B8G8R8A8_UNORM render
 * target.  The textured draw samples an 8x8 R8G8B8A8_UNORM texture (nearest,
 * clamp, explicit LOD 0) at uv = (pixel + 0.5) / 32.  Origin is upper left, y
 * grows downwards in both the target and the texture, and row 0 is first in
 * memory.
