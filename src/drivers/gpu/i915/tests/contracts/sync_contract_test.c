 * The completion and deferred-work contract, checked on the host.

 * Runs the production completion of sync.c and the production work queue of
 * workqueue.c against the single-threaded stand-in kernel of
 * host_kernel.c.  The completion checks cover a signal before the wait, a
 * wait that times out, a signal that arrives while the waiter sleeps (the
 * sleep hook stands for the interrupt), the permit count, and the reinit.
 * The work queue checks cover what holds without the worker thread ever
 * running: a queued work is deferred, not run inline; a second queue of a
 * pending work is refused; a cancel takes a pending work out; and a
 * synchronous cancel of a pending work returns without waiting.  The checks
 * that need the worker to run are described in README.md.
