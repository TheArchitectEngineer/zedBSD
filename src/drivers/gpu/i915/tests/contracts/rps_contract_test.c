 * The RPS contract (ws075-p020), checked on the host.
 *
 * Runs gt-power.c's RPS against the mock register file: the frequency caps,
 * the enable at the minimum with the LOW_POWER thresholds; the interrupt way
 * (graphics versions 6 to 11): the start that enables and unmasks the up and
 * down events and raises the request to the efficient frequency, the
 * interrupt that masks its events and queues the work, the work that steps
 * up (doubling) and down, switches the power mode and keeps PMINTRMSK and
 * RP_INTERRUPT_LIMITS with the frequency, the boost of a waiting client and
 * the stop; and the busy-time way (graphics version 12, the default): the
 * evaluations that step up while the engines are busy and down while idle,
 * the park of an idle GT at the minimum and the unpark to the efficient
 * frequency.  The work queue's and the timer's threads never run on the
 * host, so the checks run the callbacks themselves, on a clock of the
 * test's own.  It proves the contract, not the hardware.
