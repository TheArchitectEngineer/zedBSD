/*
 * Deferred work and delayed work.
 *
 * A work queue owns one worker thread that runs queued callbacks in order
 * with no lock held, following the reference's work_struct: a work is
 * PENDING while it sits in the queue and RUNNING while its callback
 * executes.  The pending state is cleared before the callback runs, so a
 * callback may queue its own work again and it runs once more.
 *
 * A timer queue adds the reference's delayed_work on top of one work queue.
 * Its timer thread sleeps on an ordinary wait queue until the earliest
 * deadline, so the scheduler tick wakes it and nothing runs in the timer
 * interrupt, then hands the due work to the work queue:
 *
 *   IDLE -> ARMED (waiting for its deadline) -> PENDING (in the work queue)
 *        -> RUNNING -> IDLE        (a running work may be armed again)
 *
 *   queue        1 = newly armed; 0 = already armed or pending (left alone)
 *   cancel       disarms or dequeues; does not wait for a running callback
 *   cancel_sync  the same, then waits until the callback is not running;
 *                the caller must not hold a lock the callback takes
