/*
 * Device runtime power management.
 *
 * This is the device runtime-PM layer only, and only the part the device
 * start needs: the early initialization, the usage count taken and dropped
 * during probe, and the cleanup.  It is kept apart from the two other power
 * concerns the reference also keeps apart -- forcewake (mmio.h) and the
 * display power domains and GT wakerefs -- so they are never merged into one
 * "power get".
 *
 * Two distinctions from the reference are kept:
 *
 *   - the early initialization (intel_runtime_pm_init_early()) only fills
 *     the structure; it is not the enable (intel_runtime_pm_enable()), which
 *     turns autosuspend on at the end of driver load.  During probe runtime PM
 *     is not enabled, so the device stays resumed and a put never suspends it.
 *   - get_sync and resume_and_get differ on failure: get_sync leaves the
 *     usage count raised, so the caller must still put; resume_and_get drops
 *     it again, so the caller must not.
 *
 * The resume and suspend themselves are reached through an operations table,
 * so the same logic runs against a mock device in the host tests.
