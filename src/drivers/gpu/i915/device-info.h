/*
 * The GT and engine information of the device.
 *
 * Before any engine runs, the driver reads what the fuses and the clock
 * registers say about this particular part: how fast the command streamer
 * timestamp ticks, which subslices and EUs survived fusing, which L3 banks
 * replicated registers can be steered to, and which engines exist.
 *
 * Gen9 (Skylake and its Gen9.5 successors) reads the same facts from the
 * Gen8 fuse layout: GEN8_FUSE2 and one GEN9_EU_DISABLE register per slice,
 * a fixed 24 MHz crystal behind CTC_MODE, and no L3 bank steering.
 *
 * Easy to get wrong, and checked by the tests:
 *
 *   - GEN11_EU_DISABLE is a disable mask with one bit per pair of EUs; each
 *     set bit of its inverse enables two EUs.
 *   - Gen12 counts Dual-Subslices: at most 1 slice, 6 DSS, 16 EUs per DSS.
 *   - GEN11_GT_VEBOX_VDBOX_DISABLE is a disable register on media versions
 *     before 12.50, so it is inverted before use.
