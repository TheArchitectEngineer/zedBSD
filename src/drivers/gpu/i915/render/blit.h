/*
 * Rectangles on the GPU: fills and copies between linear surfaces.
 *
 * Every transfer the executor performs -- attachment and image clears,
 * buffer and image copies, image copies and blits, and the display's scaled
 * copy into the scanout buffer -- is one RECTLIST drawn by the 3D pipeline,
 * the way Mesa's blorp does it on the render engine.  A rectangle names its
 * surfaces by GPU address, extent, pitch and format (struct i915_gfx_surface)
 * and holds no Vulkan object.
 *
 * A copy scales when the two rectangles differ in size, with a nearest or a
 * linear filter.  A fill writes four float words at every pixel; a depth
 * clear writes the depth value's bits through an R32_FLOAT surface.
 *
 * The rectangle is written into the session's state and batch objects
 * (draw.h), so it shares them with the session's draws and runs between
 * them.
