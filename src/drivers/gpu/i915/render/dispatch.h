/*
 * The opcode router of the Vulkan executor.
 *
 * libvulkan frames every command as a little-endian u32 opcode, a u32
 * reply-request flag, then the encoded parameters (userland/base/libvulkan
 * wire.c vulkan_command_begin).  The router reads that header, echoes the
 * opcode into the reply of a command that asks for one, and hands the
 * command to the one part that owns its opcode.
