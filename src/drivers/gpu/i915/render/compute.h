/*
 * Recorded dispatches on the GPU (ws101-p004): a compute pipeline's kernel
 * over a grid of workgroups, through the GPGPU pipeline.
 *
 * A dispatch is an operation of the submission's batch like a draw: it
 * writes its slot (the interface descriptor, the group counts and the
 * CURBE) and appends its commands, which switch the pipeline to GPGPU and
 * back to 3D.  drv_i915_gfx_dispatch() does both for the executor;
 * drv_i915_gfx_dispatch_write() and drv_i915_gfx_dispatch_build() are the
 * two halves, which the host tests drive on their own.  An indirect
 * dispatch (ws101-p007) reads its group counts from a buffer when it runs.
