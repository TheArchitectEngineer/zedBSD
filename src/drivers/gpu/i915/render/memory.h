 * it right after the allocation, and that blob, named by the allocation's
 * identity, is its storage.  Buffers and images are bound to a range of an
 * allocation.  The CPU view and the GPU address of a range are declared in
 * gfx.h, and the blob attach and detach in render.h; this file defines them.
