 * The park of the request worker for a suspend (ws052-p009).
 *
 * A suspend asks the worker to park: the worker leaves the display window
 * (the output is stopped through the reference's stop path, the lease is
 * kept), finishes the request it runs, lets the GT go idle (RPS stopped,
 * forcewake given back) and sleeps until the resume ends the park; the
 * requests that come meanwhile wait in their queues.  This file is the
 * protocol's state and decisions; the worker (worker.c) takes the device's
 * IRQ lock around every call and does the sleeping and the waking.
