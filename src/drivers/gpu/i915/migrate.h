/*
 * The migrate context (intel_migrate_init()).
 *
 * The reference builds, on the first copy engine, an address space of its own
 * and a pinned context for copies:
 *
 *   migrate_vm()            a new ppgtt; per copy engine instance i at
 *                           base = i << 32, two 8 MiB windows (source and
 *                           destination), then a PTE window right after them
 *                           with one PTE per page of the windows; page tables
 *                           for the whole range; and every page table of the
 *                           windows mapped itself, uncached, into the PTE
 *                           window, so a blit can rewrite the windows' PTEs
 *   the pinned context      a 512 KiB ring, the timeline in the engine's own
 *                           status page at I915_GEM_HWS_MIGRATE, built and
 *                           pinned as any context
 *
 * intel_gt_init() does not check the result: without a migrate context the
 * move path falls back to a CPU copy.  Alder Lake-P has one copy engine and
 * no 64K pages, so the layout is [0, 8M) source, [8M, 16M) destination and
 * [16M, 16M + 32K) PTEs.  Nothing is submitted here.
 *
 * The 512 KiB ring is larger than a DMA vector allows, so the memory layer
 * makes it one coherent allocation, and the page tables are created on demand
 * from the object pool instead of being stashed in advance under ww locks.
