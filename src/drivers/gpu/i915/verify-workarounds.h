/*
 * Engine workaround verification by the GPU itself.
 *
 * Linux __engines_verify_workarounds(), which Linux compiles only under
 * CONFIG_DRM_I915_DEBUG_GEM and which runs here always, as a diagnostic.
 * For each engine with a workaround list:
 *
 *   - a one-page scratch object is bound into the GGTT
 *     (__vm_create_scratch_for_read)
 *   - a request on the engine's kernel context stores every listed register
 *     to scratch + 4 * list index with MI_STORE_REGISTER_MEM, skipping the
 *     multicast ranges: the MCR selector steers CPU accesses only, so the
 *     command streamer would read some other instance (wa_list_srm)
 *   - the request is submitted and waited for (i915_request_wait, HZ / 5)
 *   - every stored value is compared with the list (wa_verify); an entry
 *     whose read mask is 0 always passes
 *   - the engine parks by switching back to its kernel context
 *     (intel_engine_pm_put -> switch_to_kernel_context)
 *
 * Any engine failure makes the whole verification fail, and so does a GT
 * that does not go idle afterwards (intel_gt_wait_for_idle).
 *
 * Adaptations: the wait polls the CSB and the status page for at least the
 * requested time; the park switch is submitted only once the verification
 * request has completed, since one request is kept in flight per engine; a
 * timed-out engine gets no park switch (it is hung, and a switch queued
 * behind the hang would fail the final wait the same way); the scratch page
 * is a driver object from the fixed pool rather than shmem.
