/*
 * Time base, delays, register waits and completions.
 *
 * The delays and register waits follow the reference's
 * __intel_wait_for_register_fw() and udelay(): a busy stage that never
 * sleeps, so it is safe with a spinlock held or interrupts off, and an
 * optional slow stage that sleeps between reads and may only be used from a
 * context that can sleep.  Both measure time against the kernel's monotonic
 * counter, which neither depends on interrupts nor jumps when the thread
 * moves to another CPU.
 *
 * A failure of the time base itself is kept apart from a hardware timeout:
 * it is reported as EIO and latched once for the whole driver, so a caller
 * never mistakes a broken clock for an elapsed delay or an unresponsive
 * register.
 *
 * A completion counts its signals the way the reference's struct completion
 * does: each complete adds one permit and each successful wait consumes one.
