 * DMA mapping.
 *
 * The single place through which the driver reaches DMA.  It keeps three
 * things apart that are easy to blur:
 *
 *   1. Address kinds are distinct types.  A CPU physical address (a
 *      guest-physical one inside a VM) is mapped to a device DMA address
 *      before it can reach a GPU page table.  Under QEMU with VFIO the two
 *      happen to be numerically equal, so feeding one where the other
 *      belongs goes unnoticed; the types make the compiler refuse it.
 *   2. Each entry point keeps the return contract of the Linux call it
 *      stands for; there is no generic "nonzero means failure":
 *        drv_i915_dma_set_info       0, or a positive errno
 *        drv_i915_dma_map_sg         the mapped segment count, or 0 (dma_map_sg)
 *        drv_i915_dma_map_sgtable    0, or a positive errno (dma_map_sgtable)
 *        drv_i915_dma_map_page       an address tested with
 *                                    drv_i915_dma_mapping_failed()
 *   3. A mapping is an owned resource with a pin count.  While it is pinned
 *      into a GPU page table it can be neither unmapped nor freed.
 *
 * The address production sits behind an operations table, so the same
 * bookkeeping runs against a mock in the host tests and against the kernel's
 * drv_dma_* device in the driver.  An operation the table leaves out is
 * recorded as unimplemented, never passed off as a refusal by the hardware.
