/*
 * The hotplug of the display 11 to 13 code (xd-hpd.c): the hotplug pins
 * of the north display (the Type-C and Thunderbolt pins) and of the south
 * display (the DDI and Type-C pins), and the connectors behind them.
 *
 * The pins are armed from the ports the display has.  An interrupt is
 * acknowledged and sorted into pulses: a port that takes its own pulses
 * (DisplayPort) gets them through the pulse work, any other pin becomes a
 * detection event.  A pin that raises too many interrupts in a second is
 * masked and armed again two minutes later.  The detection reads a
 * connector's state: the live state and the EDID over GMBUS of an HDMI
 * connector, the live state and the sink's probe of a Type-C DisplayPort
 * connector (through the hooks of struct i915_xd_hpd_env), and asks for
 * another look when nothing changed (a sink still waking up).
 *
 * Locking: the pins' state, the pending pulses and events are the
 * caller's to protect with one spinlock, which the interrupt takes too;
 * the functions that take that lock's protection say so.  The connectors
 * are the detection's, which the caller serializes with one mutex; the
 * hooks of the detection run under that mutex and take only their own
 * locks.  No function here takes a lock.
