/*
 * The power wells of the display 12 and 13 code (xd-power.c).
 *
 * The display hardware is split into power wells, each switched through
 * a request bit and reporting through a state bit of one of three
 * controls (the main wells, the AUX wells, the DDI IO wells).  The
 * platform's description lists the wells with what each one needs: the
 * power gate whose fuses it waits for, whether it holds the VGA plane,
 * the pipes whose interrupt registers it holds, and whether it is the
 * Thunderbolt AUX well of a Type-C port.
 *
 * Around a well whose loss clears pipe interrupt registers the owner's
 * hooks restore the interrupts after it comes up and drain them before
 * it goes down; a drain that fails keeps the well on.  A well that holds
 * the VGA plane has the VGA registers rewritten after it comes up.  The
 * AUX well of a Type-C port in DisplayPort or legacy mode waits for its
 * PHY's microcontroller through the owner's hook.  The caller serializes
 * the calls (the power domains' lock).
 *
 * Above the switching, the counts keep who uses each well: a user names
 * the functions it needs (a pipe, a transcoder, the lanes or the IO of a
 * DDI, an AUX channel, the VGA plane, the exit from DC states), and the
 * wells whose sets hold them are brought up for the first user and taken
 * down after the last, the owner doing the switching.
 *
 * The DC states let the DMC firmware power the display down while it is
 * idle: the DC off well keeps the display out of them, and when it loses
 * its last user the state the options and the loaded firmware allow is
 * written.  DC9, the deepest, is entered around suspend with the PCH's
 * reference clock let go.

 * port's PHY (0 for the first port) after its AUX well came up, and
 * reports 0, ETIMEDOUT (only noted) or EIO (the time base failed).  Any
