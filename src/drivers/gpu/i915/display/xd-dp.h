/*
 * The DisplayPort link of the display 12 and 13 code (xd-dp.c).
 *
 * A link is chosen before it is trained.  The rates a link can run at are
 * those both ends offer: the source's table up to the platform's and the
 * VBT's limit, the sink's standard rates up to its own limit and that of
 * any repeaters (or the list an eDP 1.4 panel gives).  For a mode, the
 * deepest colour first, then the lowest rate and the fewest lanes that
 * carry the mode's pixel rate is the link.  A link that fails to train
 * falls to the next lower shared rate, and below the lowest to half the
 * lanes at the highest rate.  The link's M/N values tell the transcoder
 * the stream's share of the link and the pixel clock against the link's
 * symbol clock.
 *
 * Training brings the sink's receivers up one after the other: any
 * repeaters (link training tunable PHY repeaters) from the highest
 * numbered down to repeater 1, then the sink.  Before it the repeaters are found and switched to
 * non-transparent mode, the sink's capabilities read again, and the
 * rate, lane count and coding written to the sink.  Each receiver is
 * trained in two phases: clock recovery with pattern 1, starting at the
 * lowest levels and following the levels the receiver asks for, and
 * channel equalization with the best pattern both ends know, again
 * following the receiver's requests.  The source's side of each step
 * (its signal levels, its pattern, the preparation of the port, the idle
 * pattern afterwards) is a hook of the caller; the sink's side is DPCD
 * access through another.
 *
 * Only 8b/10b links are trained: the platforms of this code do not drive
 * 128b/132b rates.
 *
 * Before a link, the sink of an external DisplayPort port is probed over
 * its AUX channel (struct i915_xd_dp_probe, the cache of one port): its
 * receiver capabilities, the repeaters in front of it, whether it is a
 * branch device (a USB-C to HDMI or DisplayPort adapter, a protocol
 * converter) with a display behind it, and the display's EDID.  The probe
 * does not switch repeaters to non-transparent mode (the training does),
 * drives every sink as one stream, and applies no DPCD quirk.  The AUX
 * transfers and the log come through struct i915_xd_dp_probe_env.
