 * The second output, the head (ws113-p011; the design is
 * plan/ws113/phase011/design.md).
 *
 * While Keiland holds the resident output's lease, a claim of another
 * connected connector makes it the head (head-rules.c decides): an HDMI
 * or an external DisplayPort display on pipe B beside the built-in panel
 * on pipe A.  The claim writes no hardware; it prepares the output (its
 * mode, link and PLL) and gives the head a lease of its own.
 *
 * The head's first frame lights it, on the worker, from inside the display
 * window the resident output keeps: modeset screen 1, a run context of its
 * own (its hooks, its vblank event and frame counter on its pipe, its
 * power references), two buffers at its mode's size.  Its DBUF share is
 * computed for both pipes, and so must the resident output's: when the
 * resident output was lit for one pipe, the window is left and the
 * resident output lit again for two first (the 2026-10-07 user decision,
 * present.c).  Each frame is copied into the head's back buffer and
 * flipped to, as the resident output's are.  The head's release, and the
 * window's end, stop it and the output goes dark (D-RELEASE, no hold).
 *
 * A head that cannot be lit beside the resident output latches its
 * connector limited until the topology moves (D-LIMIT): its claims are
 * the limit meanwhile, so the compositor does not light the resident
 * output again and again for a head that will not come up.
 *
 * Every modeset call on the head's screen is made with screen 1 selected,
 * and the worker leaves with screen 0 selected again: the resident
 * output's flips and light assume it.
