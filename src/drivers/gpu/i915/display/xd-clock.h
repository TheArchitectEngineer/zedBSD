/*
 * The display clocks of the display 12 and 13 code (xd-clock.c): the CD
 * clock and the combo port PLLs.
 *
 * The CD clock runs the display engine.  It comes from a PLL on the
 * reference clock (its ratio sets the PLL's rate) through a CD2X divider,
 * or, with the PLL off, it is the bypass clock, half the reference.  The
 * platform's table lists the CD clocks with their ratios; each CD clock
 * needs a voltage level, which the firmware is told after the change, as
 * it is asked before it whether the change may go ahead.
 *
 * At the display's start a CD clock the firmware left that is one of the
 * table's is kept; any other, a PLL that is off, or a bypass clock is
 * replaced by the table's lowest.  The platforms that can change the
 * PLL's ratio while it runs (display 13) crawl to a new one; the others,
 * and any change from a PLL that is off or in an unknown state, turn the
 * PLL off and on again.
 *
 * The port PLLs give the DDIs their link clocks.  A combo DPLL is
 * programmed with a DCO (an integer and a 15-bit fraction of the
 * reference) and three dividers: for a DisplayPort link rate from the
 * table, for an HDMI clock by choosing the dividers that put the DCO
 * nearest the middle of its range.  With a 38.4 MHz reference the PLL
 * divides the reference by 2, so the 19.2 MHz words serve, and some
 * platforms take the fraction halved.  The PLL is powered, written,
 * enabled and waited on through its enable word; a DDI takes its clock
 * from a combo DPLL through the platform's DPCLKA select, which is
 * written before the DDI's clock is ungated, in a separate write.
 *
 * A Type-C port's PLL is in its Dekel PHY.  Its feedback divider (an
 * integer and a 22-bit fraction of twice the reference) puts its DCO at
 * 8.1 GHz for every DisplayPort link rate, or in a range for an HDMI
 * clock; a high-speed divider (2, 3, 5 or 7) and a second divider bring
 * the DCO down to the link clock.  Its words are written through the
 * PHY's window (xd-tc.c) between the power and the enable of the PLL's
 * enable word, which stays in the display's registers.  A Type-C port's
 * DDI selects its own TC PLL, or one of the Thunderbolt PLL's link rates,
 * in its own clock select, and its clock is ungated in DPCLKA_CFGCR0.
