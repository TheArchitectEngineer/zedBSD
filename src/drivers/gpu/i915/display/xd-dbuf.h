/*
 * The display buffer and the watermarks of the display 12 and 13 code
 * (xd-dbuf.c).
 *
 * The display buffer (DBUF) is split into slices; the platform's table
 * tells which slices each pipe of a set of active pipes uses, and on
 * display 13 whether one lone pipe joins the memory bus to all four.  A
 * pipe's share of its slices goes by the width of its mode against the
 * other pipes on the same slices; within it the cursor takes a fixed
 * part at the end, every plane its smallest allocation for the deepest
 * watermark level that fits, and what is left goes by the planes' data
 * rates.
 *
 * A plane's watermark of a level is how many blocks (and lines) the
 * plane must have buffered to ride out the memory latency of that level:
 * the larger of the bytes the plane fetches in the latency (method 1)
 * and the lines it crosses in it (method 2), as the memory latency, the
 * pixel rate and the line time decide.  The transition watermark, the
 * SAGV watermark (level 0 with the SAGV block time added) and its
 * transition follow from level 0.  Levels whose latency does not fit the
 * vertical blank, and levels the allocation cannot hold, are turned off;
 * a level turned off keeps the blocks and lines of the one below it.
 *
 * The writes: each plane's watermark words and its buffer range, the
 * slices' power (each one requested, then checked after 10 us), the
 * memory bus's joining and the slices' tracker service, and each pipe's
 * data box credits.
