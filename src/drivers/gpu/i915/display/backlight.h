 * The panel's backlight as a backlight device (backlight.c, ws113-p013).
 *
 * A node whose output is the eDP panel registers it with the kernel's
 * backlight class (/dev/backlight/backlight0) when the request worker
 * starts serving the published node, and withdraws it when the worker is
 * asked to stop, while the worker still answers.  A request is queued to the
 * request worker, which alone touches the panel's modeset state, and is
 * answered from inside the display window.
 *
 * The header is neutral: the request worker (../worker.c) includes it
 * without the display's types.
