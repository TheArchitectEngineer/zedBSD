/*
 * The display control of the resident output (ws113-p012).
 *
 * Refresh: the boundaries are the pipe's own frames.  The resident run
 * leaves the vblank interrupt masked, so the pipe's hardware frame counter
 * (PIPE_FRMCOUNT) is read each millisecond while a caller waits and
 * extended to a count that never goes back: a counter that went back is a
 * pipe lit again, and only what it counts from then on is added.  The
 * counter is read only while the display window is up, under the lock the
 * worker takes to lower display_up before the pipe stops.
 *
 * Power: the eDP panel's light is switched off or on by the worker (the
 * pipe keeps running, so SUSPEND is the same as OFF), for the open holding
 * the lease once a frame of it is shown; the lease's end switches it on.
