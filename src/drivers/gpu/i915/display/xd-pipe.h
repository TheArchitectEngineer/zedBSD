/*
 * The transcoders and pipes of the display 12 and 13 code (xd-pipe.c).
 *
 * On these displays every transcoder belongs to the pipe of the same
 * index.  A transcoder makes the timing of a mode: its totals, blanks
 * and syncs, the M/N values of a DisplayPort stream, the variable
 * refresh words, the pixel multiplier, the frame start delay, and its
 * configuration word (interlace, enable).  On display 13 the vertical
 * blank start is not written as a timing but as the set context latency.
 * Its DDI function word ties it to a DDI with the output's mode (HDMI,
 * DVI, DisplayPort single or multi stream), colour depth, sync polarity
 * and lane count; a DisplayPort stream also carries its MSA word.
 *
 * The first plane of a pipe scans out a linear XRGB8888 buffer: its
 * words that do not arm an update (stride in 64-byte units, position,
 * size, the colour key and plane alpha, the offset, the auxiliary
 * distance, the chroma upsampler, the colour control) go first, the
 * pipe's watermarks after them (the caller's), then the control word and
 * the surface address, which arms the update at the next vertical blank.
 * The live surface tells which buffer the pipe scans.  Turning the plane
 * off writes the upsampler, then (after the watermarks) a zero control
 * word and surface.
 *
 * The pipe takes the planes' pixels: its source size, its miscellaneous
 * word (the colour depth of what it sends, dithering, YUV output, the
 * rounding), its chicken word, and the colour words that pass pixels
 * through (a black bottom colour, the gamma and CSC modes).
 *
 * Starting a transcoder enables it once the planes are off (on display
 * 13 the pipe arbiter takes the programmed slots first); stopping it
 * clears the enable, releases a DisplayPort FEC stall, and waits up to
 * 100 ms for the transcoder to report itself off.  The pipe's frame
 * counter and scan line tell whether it runs.
