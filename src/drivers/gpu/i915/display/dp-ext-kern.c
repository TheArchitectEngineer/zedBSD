 * The display's external DP ports (see dp-ext-kern.h).
 *
 * Each Type-C port the display declares is an external DP port with an
 * AUX channel of its own (xd-aux.c).  Every access of a sink holds the
 * Type-C port in the mode it is in (a port no output holds is brought up
 * to what is plugged in, its PHY taken for the access and given back
 * after), refuses a port that is not held for DisplayPort or whose partner
 * went, powers the channel and the display core, and takes the lock all
 * the external ports' accesses share.
 *
 * A probe holds a link on the Type-C port for its whole length, so the
 * port's PHY stays with the display between the accesses, and gives the
 * link back at the end: the port's last link gives the PHY back at once,
 * so a port the display does not drive is released as soon as it has been
 * looked at (the firmware updates the other Type-C ports' hot plug only
 * after that).  The sink's probe itself is xd-dp.c.
