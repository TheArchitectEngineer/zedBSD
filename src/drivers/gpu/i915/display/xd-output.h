 * One output of a screen of the display 12 and 13 code, lit and darkened
 * step by step (xd-output.c).
 *
 * A screen's light and dark (xd-screen.c) run their steps in a fixed
 * order; this is what each step does for an output whose description the
 * caller filled from its plan: the power the output uses, the display
 * buffer's slices and the bus's joining, the panel's backlight, the
 * pipe's DMC, the AUX power of the link, the port's PLL, the port and its
 * link (the panel's power, the DDI clock, the transcoder's function, the
 * signal levels, the sink woken and the link trained), the pipe (its
 * source, its word, the transcoder's timing and the colours), and the
 * output (the transcoder started, the backlight on).  The dark undoes
 * them in reverse: the backlight off, the transcoder stopped and its
 * function cleared, the sink put to sleep, the port stopped and its
 * clock gated, the panel's power off, the PLL, the AUX power, the pipe's
 * DMC, and the power and buffer given back last.
 *
 * Everything outside the registers is the caller's, through the
 * environment: the power references (by what the output uses them for),
 * the panel's power sequencer, the sink's DPCD, the display buffer's
 * slices, the locks, the vertical blank events of the pipe and the notes
 * of the run.  The output keeps what it holds (the references, the PLL,
 * the link's state, the backlight's levels), so a dark gives back exactly
 * what a light took, and a light that failed half way is darkened the
 * same way.
 *
 * Three kinds of output are driven: the built-in panel (eDP), an HDMI
 * or DVI sink on a combo port, and an external DisplayPort sink on a
 * Type-C port.  A Type-C port's PHY (its DisplayPort mode, its signal
 * levels, its core reset) and its own PLL are driven here through the
 * Dekel PHY's window, or on display 11 (Ice Lake) in the MG PHY's own
 * registers; what the port's connection holds (its link to the
 * PHY, the mode it is in, its lanes and pin assignment, and the
 * Thunderbolt PLL the Type-C ports share) is the caller's, through the
 * environment's Type-C hooks.
 *
 * Display 11 orders a DisplayPort port as its own generation does: the
 * transcoder's function is not written before the training and its
 * clock follows the trained link, the transport is the port's own (not
 * the transcoder's), the eDP transcoder takes its pipe in its function
 * word and has no clock select, and a stop takes the clock off the
 * transcoder before the DDI buffer stops.
