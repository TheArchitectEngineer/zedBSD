/*
 * The firmware's description of the display for the display 12 and 13
 * code (xd-vbt.c): where the ACPI OpRegion keeps the Video BIOS Table
 * (VBT), and what the VBT says.
 *
 * The VBT lists the outputs the board wires (one child device each: its
 * DDI, its AUX channel and DDC pin, what it can carry, its link limits)
 * and describes the built-in panel (its timing, power sequence delays,
 * backlight and eDP link).  The parse reads the bytes in place and
 * copies the values out; it keeps no pointer into them except for the
 * panel pass, which reads them again, so the bytes must stay mapped
 * until the panel is parsed.  A VBT the code cannot use is refused as a
 * whole, and the display then runs on the defaults a missing VBT gets
 * (an eDP panel on DDI A, DisplayPort and DVI on the other non Type-C
 * DDIs).
 *
 * Nothing here touches the hardware; the mapping of the OpRegion and of
 * the VBT is the caller's.
