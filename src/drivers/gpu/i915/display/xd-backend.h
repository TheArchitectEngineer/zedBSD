 * sink over AUX, run the panel's power sequencer, take display power,
 * ask for display buffer slices, wait for vertical blanks and take the
 * Type-C ports' links through one table of hooks.  The kernel fills it

 * model is 1 for a register model, whose retained state may be thrown
 * away with the model, and 0 for the hardware.  The register hooks write,
 * read-modify-write (answering the old value), read and wait; usleep may
 * yield, udelay does not.  The DPCD hooks reach the panel's sink.  panel
 * runs one step of the panel's power sequencer (0 when done).
 *
 * Display power is asked for by domain: power_domain names the domain of
 * one use of an output (the use and unit numbers of xd-output.h, and
 * whether a Type-C port runs in Thunderbolt mode), and the get, put and
 * delayed put take that number; get answers a nonzero cookie or 0.  The
 * numbering belongs to the backend.  power_get_if_enabled takes the
 * reference only when the domain is on already (NULL: the backend keeps
 * no state of its own).
 *
 * dbuf_slices_update asks for exactly the display buffer slices of the
 * mask.  The vertical blank hooks take and give back a pipe's interrupt
 * reference, sleep until the next blank or until the ticks of 10 ms run
 * out (answering the ticks left), turn interrupts off and on around a
 * short update, arm the completion event of the pipe's next blank, wait
 * for it (0, -110 when it did not come in time, -5 on a broken time
 * base) and give it up for good.
 *
 * observe is told the named points of a commit (may be NULL).  lock
 * takes (take 1) or drops (take 0) the PLL lock (0) or the backlight
 * lock (1).  error is told every error of a commit, the first one being
 * what a failed run is read from; debug every note.  step records a
 * callee the older display code did not carry over.
 *
 * The Type-C hooks take and give back an output's link to a port (0 is
 * the first Type-C port), answer the mode the port is held in, give the
 * display the lanes and answer the pin assignment; the Dekel hooks reach
 * a port's PHY registers under the lock the ports share.  All of them
 * are NULL in a model, which records a step instead.
