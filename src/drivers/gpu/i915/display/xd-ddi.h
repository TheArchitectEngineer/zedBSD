/*
 * The DDIs of the display 12 and 13 code (xd-ddi.c): the combo PHYs and
 * the DDI buffers.
 *
 * A combo PHY drives the lanes of one DDI.  It is brought up once, at the
 * display's start (and again after DC states that lose it): its IO
 * compensation is powered, its duty cycle corrector set to run once, its
 * process and voltage reference values written, the compensation started
 * (on the PHYs that own the compensation resistor the reference current
 * first) and its common lane allowed to power down.  A PHY whose state
 * already reads as brought up, as the firmware leaves PHY A, is not
 * written.  Before a suspend every PHY's compensation is stopped.
 *
 * A port powers up only the lanes its link uses.  Its signal levels come
 * from the platform's swing table of its kind (DisplayPort by rate, eDP by
 * rate and by the VBT's low swing or HOBL setting, HDMI): each lane takes
 * the row of the level the sink asked for, with the load generator of the
 * lane, and the change is latched by the training enable.
 *
 * The DDI buffer drives the link.  For DisplayPort its word carries the
 * lane count and lane reversal (and on a display 13 Type-C port the PHY
 * link rate); the link starts with the transport in training pattern 1
 * and the buffer enabled, then waits for the buffer to leave idle.  On a
 * Type-C port the PHY ownership bit belongs to the Type-C code: the
 * buffer keeps whatever it holds.  A link that is already running is
 * stopped first.  The stop clears the buffer, the transport and FEC, and
 * waits for the buffer to go idle.
