 * The AUX channels of the display 12 and 13 code (xd-aux.c): one
 * transaction on one channel, from loading the request into the data
 * words to unloading the sink's reply.
 *
 * A transaction is only the hardware exchange.  The caller has already
 * made the channel usable: the display is initialized, the channel's
 * power well is on, the display is held out of its deep power states,
 * and an eDP panel's VDD is on.  The caller also holds the channel's
 * lock for the whole transaction, so no two transactions of one device
 * overlap.  What a reply means (an acknowledgement, a refusal, a request
 * to retry later) is in its first byte, which the caller reads; the
 * channel only reports whether the bytes went out and came back.
