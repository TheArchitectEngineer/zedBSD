/*
 * The Type-C ports of the display 11 to 13 code (xd-tc-port.c): which
 * mode each port is held in, and when the display takes its PHY and
 * gives it back.
 *
 * A port is declared once, with whether a connector is wired to it
 * (legacy) and its AUX channel.  The port is then held in a mode that
 * follows what is plugged in: a legacy connector over a DisplayPort
 * alternate mode partner over a Thunderbolt one; with nothing plugged in
 * a legacy port stays legacy and a receptacle is left to Thunderbolt.
 * The connection itself (the PHY taken, TC cold blocked, the lanes
 * checked) is the platform's flow in xd-tc.c.
 *
 * Every output that drives a port holds a link on it; while one does,
 * the mode stays.  A step that uses the PHY without an output locks the
 * port, which brings its mode up to date first, and the unlock of a port
 * no link holds gives the PHY back at once (the firmware does not update
 * the other Type-C ports' hotplug state while one is held without its
 * sink).
 *
 * What the ports need from the device -- a lock per port, the power
 * wells by function, a clock and a sleep, the log -- comes through
 * struct i915_xd_tc_port_env and struct i915_xd_tc_power.  The port lock
 * is taken before any power well's lock and a thread may sleep under it.
