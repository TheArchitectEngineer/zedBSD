/*
 * The external displays of a Gen9 node (gen9-node.c, WS237 stage 3).
 *
 * With i915.gen9.display=modeset (or full), and the panel flipped
 * (gen9-flip.c), a node offers a display for every sink attached to ports
 * B to D beside the panel's display: display id 1 + port, one plane, the
 * mode chosen from the sink's EDID.  A claim lights the output on a free
 * pipe (gen9-outputs.c) showing black; a presentation is drawn by the GPU
 * into the buffer the plane does not show and flipped to; the release
 * darkens it.  A work reads the ports' hotplug state every second: a
 * sink that comes or goes moves the display events' sequence, and a lit
 * output whose sink went is darkened and its lease ended.  A mode set or a
 * flip of an output that fails, or the panel's flips failing, withdraws
 * every external display for the rest of the boot (gen9-display.h).
 *
 * bootfb.c, the panel's display, hands the operations on these display
 * ids and leases to the functions here.  None of them is called with the
 * panel's lease mutex held: the node takes its own mutex first, then the
 * panel's while it moves the panel's watermarks.
