/*
 * The Type-C PHYs of the display 12 and 13 code (xd-tc.c): the register
 * side of the Dekel PHY of each Type-C port.
 *
 * A Dekel PHY's registers are larger than the 4 KiB MMIO window each port
 * has: the upper bits of a PHY offset name a bank, which an index register
 * in front of the windows selects.  One index register serves four ports,
 * so the index write and the access through the window it selects are
 * made under one lock that every port shares, the innermost lock of the
 * xd display.  The display owns one struct i915_xd_dkl with that lock.
 *
 * Every PHY access of the xd code goes through the struct: the PHY
 * microcontroller's health after a Type-C AUX well came up, the lanes'
 * DisplayPort mode for the pin assignment, the transmit swing of the
 * lanes from the platform's Dekel table, the release of the lanes' PCS
 * soft reset, and the words of the port's PLL (xd-clock.c).  A caller
 * that has its own route to the PHY (a host test's model, or the older
 * modeset while it still records its writes) gives the struct hooks
 * instead, and the hooks' owner keeps the lock.
 *
 * The connection of a port is made with the platform's flow: the FIA
 * flow of display 12 (Tiger Lake: TC cold blocked through the firmware,
 * the live state, ready and ownership in the FIA's words, which a
 * modular FIA keeps for two ports each) or the TCSS flow of display 13
 * (the live state in the hotplug interrupt words, ready in the TCSS
 * status, the ownership in the DDI buffer word under the port's lane
 * well, TC cold blocked by the port's AUX well except in Thunderbolt
 * mode).  The connect takes and the disconnect gives back what the flow
 * needs, through the owner's power wells; the state machine around them
 * (when to connect, the delayed disconnect) is the caller's.
 *
 * A Type-C port is numbered here from 0 (TC1), except in a port
 * description (struct i915_xd_port_desc), whose tc counts from 1.
