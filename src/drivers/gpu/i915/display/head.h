 * While Keiland holds the resident output's lease, a claim of another
 * connected connector makes it the head: an HDMI or an external
 * DisplayPort display on pipe B beside the built-in panel on pipe A.  Its
 * first frame lights it from inside the display window, its release and
 * the window's end stop it, and the output goes dark (D-RELEASE).

 * The header is neutral: the request worker (../worker.c) includes it
