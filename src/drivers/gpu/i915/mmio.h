/*
 * Register access and forcewake.
 *
 * Most GT registers sit in a power domain that sleeps unless forcewake holds
 * it awake; a read of a sleeping register returns all-ones and a write to it
 * is dropped without any error.  Every access path here therefore states who
 * holds the register's domain:
 *
 *   held   the caller holds the domain across a sequence of accesses; the
 *          access refuses (and records) a register whose domain is asleep
 *   auto   the access takes and releases the domain around itself
 *   raw    no bookkeeping at all, for the init and reset paths that hold
 *          every domain they touch
 *
 * The bus access and the forcewake request and acknowledge registers are
 * reached through an operations table, so the same logic runs against a
 * mock register file in the host tests.
