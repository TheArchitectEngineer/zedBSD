/*
 * The queue of the Vulkan executor: the submission, the fences, the
 * semaphores and the events, and the completions of a node session (its
 * job markers and its queued frames) that the service thread retires as
 * the GPU passes their tickets.  A retirement counts what it took as the
 * session's completing until each is reported to the core, so that a
 * drain or a stop never says that a session is done while a completion
 * of it is still being reported.
 *
 * One ring is the one queue, so the submissions run in the order they
 * are placed: a semaphore needs no wait of its own, and a fence or a job
 * is done when the ticket of the last submission before it is.  A
 * submission places the packets of its command buffers (vk-execute.c)
 * in the device's GHCI session and a fence after them; one whose command
 * buffers record nothing places the fence alone.  An event is a word of
 * the device's data heap, which the host sets and resets here and the
 * GPU with a fence.  A query pool's slots are in the data heap too, and
 * the host reads its results there.
 *
 * A submission that waits for an event nothing earlier in it sets is
 * held back from its cut on (vk-execute.c), and so is every later
 * submission of the device, in order: the ring never waits for a word
 * the client writes, so a wait that never ends stops no other session
 * and not the display.  The kernel places a held submission's next
 * piece once the events of its cut are set and no placed work writes
 * them any more: when the host sets an event (on the client's thread,
 * which may wait for the ring's room) and at each round of the service
 * thread, after each fence interrupt (which only tries the session's
 * hold_lock and enters only a free ring with room now).  A fence, a job
 * marker or a frame behind held work completes once that work has run;
 * held work ends with an error when its session stops, is isolated or
 * closes, its device goes, the GPU is lost, or a reset ends the
 * device's placed work.
