 * The GPU's address spaces: the page tables of each session, the VRAM its
 * work uses, and the runs of that work on the rings.
 *
 * Every session (and every check of the driver's own) has an address
 * space of four levels of page tables in VRAM the CPU writes through its
 * window, and an identifier the interrupt controller attaches to the page
 * faults of the space's work.  Buffers of VRAM (backings) are mapped into
 * a space at addresses from 4 GiB on.  A run hands the space one of the
 * graphics hub's contexts 1 to 15 for as long as it keeps it
 * (context-pool.c), drops the context's cached translations on the ring
 * when needed, has the ring run the space's indirect buffer in that
 * context and waits for the fence after it.  A page fault of a space's
 * work, or a run that does not end in time, loses the space: it runs
 * nothing more, and its session is told.
