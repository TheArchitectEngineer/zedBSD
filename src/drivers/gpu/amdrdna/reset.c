/*
 * The reset of the GPU and its setting up again.
 *
 * A reset runs on the bring-up thread, between stages, for one of three
 * reasons: a secure OS left by an earlier driver is found when the
 * stages that write are about to run (the boot), root asks through the
 * control device, or the GPU core asks to recover a faulted GPU before a
 * fresh open.  The thread first stops what runs (the renderer takes no
 * work, the engines are halted, the power unit is told it will be
 * unloaded, the secure OS's ring is destroyed, the interrupt ring is
 * turned off), keeps what the reset loses (the PCI configuration, the
 * resizable BARs' sizes, the system-memory table, the display pipe), asks
 * the secure OS for a mode-1 reset, gives the function its configuration
 * back, waits for the boot loader, runs the video BIOS's post on the
 * driver's runner, and sets the GPU up again as far as the stages had
 * (the memory hubs and the table, the display pipe, the secure OS and
 * its programs, the power unit, the engines and the address spaces).
 * Memory training is not run again: the post initializes the memory.
 *
 * The boot reset is allowed by amdrdna.reset=1, as is the recovery the
 * GPU core asks for; root's request through the control device always
 * runs.  The buffers the stages took are kept across a reset and only
 * written again, since VRAM is taken as lost.
