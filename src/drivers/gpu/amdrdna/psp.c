/*
 * Stage A3: the interrupt ring on, and the security processor's firmware.
 *
 * The security processor (PSP) starts every other engine's firmware: the
 * driver hands its boot loader the key database, the system driver and
 * the secure OS one at a time, then talks to the secure OS through a ring
 * of command frames.  Through the ring it reads the firmware's table of
 * contents (which says how large a trusted region of VRAM the programs
 * need), loads the system-management unit's program, sets up the trusted
 * region, loads the copy engines', the command processors' and the
 * run-list controller's programs, starts the run-list controller's load
 * of the graphics programs, and loads the display security application.
 *
 * The firmware files are read from the root file system first and checked
 * before anything is written to the processor.  Once the secure OS runs,
 * only a cold power cycle takes it away: the stop at shutdown unloads what
 * the driver loaded and destroys the ring, but the secure OS stays.
