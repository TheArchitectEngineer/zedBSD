/*
 * The stage marks of the amdrdna driver and its boot parameters.
 *
 * The driver brings the GPU up one stage at a time: A0 finds and
 * identifies it, A1 reads what the firmware put on the display, A1v reads
 * the video BIOS, and the later stages start the GPU's engines.  Each
 * stage writes "amdrdna: <stage> begin" before it starts and one line with
 * "ok" and its values, or "fail" and the reason, when it ends, so the
 * console and the kernel log show how far the driver came.
 *
 * The parameters are read from the raw boot command line, because the
 * driver attaches while the platform finds its devices, before the kernel
 * parses the line:
 *
 *   amdrdna.off=1        the driver does not look at the GPU at all
 *   amdrdna.auto=<stage> the stages up to this one run at boot without
 *                        being asked (A1v when the word is absent)
 *   amdrdna.train=0      memory training (stage A3t) is skipped
 *   amdrdna.train.blank=0
 *                        the firmware's picture is not blanked while
 *                        memory training runs
 *   amdrdna.fan.duty=<n> the static fan duty in percent (50 by default)
 *   amdrdna.temp.max=<n> the temperature in degrees Celsius past which the
 *                        driver faults the GPU (95 by default)
 *   amdrdna.kiq=0        stage A5 runs the graphics ring by its registers,
 *                        without the scheduler's queue and the compute
 *                        queues
