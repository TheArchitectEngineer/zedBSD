 * The GPU's interrupt ring.

 * Every block of the GPU reports its events to the interrupt controller,
 * which writes each one as a 32-byte entry into a ring in system memory,
 * copies its write pointer into a word of system memory, and signals the
 * CPU with a message.  The message handler only notes the signal and wakes
 * the interrupt thread; the thread reads the entries up to the copied
 * write pointer, hands each to the block it belongs to, and rings the
 * controller's doorbell with how far it read.  Stage A2 prepares the ring
 * and the thread with the ring off; stage A3 turns it on.
