 * The waits, the hazard breaks and the assembly of the amdrdna shader
 * compiler (gfx10-wait.h).
 *
 * The waits: an instruction that reads or writes a register a memory
 * instruction has not yet filled waits first, by the counter of that
 * memory instruction, until the counter has fallen far enough.  The
 * vector memory loads and the shared memory accesses finish in the order
 * they were issued, so a register filled by one of them is ready once the
 * counter is no more than the number of those issued after it; a scalar
 * load may finish in any order and an export is only followed to its
 * end, so theirs wait for zero.  The export reads its registers late, so a
 * write to one of them waits for the export counter.
 *
 * The hazards: GFX10.1 has four sequences the hardware does not guard,
 * each broken by an instruction placed between their two halves (the
 * VMEMtoScalarWrite, SMEMtoVectorWrite, VcmpxExecWAR and LdsBranchVmemWAR
 * hazards).
 *
 * The pass walks the list once per pass.  What it knows at a label is
 * everything it knew on each path into it: the line that falls into the
 * label and each branch to it.  A loop's label learns of its back branch
 * only at the end of a pass, so the walk is repeated until no label
 * learns anything new; should that take too many passes, a last pass
 * waits for everything and breaks every hazard at each label and branch
 * instead, which is always correct.
