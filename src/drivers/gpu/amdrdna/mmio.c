 * Register and VRAM access of the amdrdna driver.

 * Registers are named by dword index.  An index inside the mapped register
 * window is read directly; the few registers beyond it, and the
 * system-management unit's words, go through the indirect register window
 * (an address register and a data register).  VRAM outside the CPU's
 * window is read one dword at a time through the indirect VRAM window.
 * Each indirect window is two steps that must not interleave with
 * another user's, so each has its own spinlock, taken with interrupts
 * off.
