 * The work channel of the nvrtx driver: the parts that touch no hardware.

 * The work channel (work.c) is the graphics channel the GPU device keeps for
 * the work it is given: one address space the driver owns over the 3.5 GiB at
 * NVRTX_WORK_VA_BASE, whose low part holds the graphics context's buffers at
 * the golden context's addresses, then the driver's own pages (the ring, the
 * semaphore and the fences' push buffers), then the runs the device maps for
 * its users and the regions of the sessions' own channels, which share the
 * space.  Each submission takes two ring entries: the caller's push buffer
 * segment, then a fence of the driver's that releases the next value of the
 * semaphore.
