 * The GPU's performance level.

 * The resource manager in the GSP chooses the clocks of the GPU's
 * performance states by itself; the driver gives it no advice.  After the
 * work channel is up, this file asks the resource manager which state the
 * GPU is in and writes it into the kernel log, and when the boot asks
 * (nvrtx.boost=1) it asks the resource manager to hold the GPU at its
 * highest state until power-off, then reads the state again.  The
 * controls are the subdevice's performance controls.
 *
 * It runs during the boot's stages, before the message drain starts, so
 * the calls do not share the GSP's queues with the drain.  Nothing here
 * fails the boot: a refused control is only written into the log.
