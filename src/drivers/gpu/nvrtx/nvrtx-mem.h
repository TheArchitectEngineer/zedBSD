 * objects, page tables and surfaces, ws037-p005 stage P4m); a second one
 * hands out runs of the CPU's window onto the VRAM (BAR1).  Both keep the
 * free runs in order, take a new run from the highest free run that holds
 * it (away from the low VRAM the firmware's picture lies in), and merge a
 * freed run with its neighbours.  The caller serializes the calls.
