 * The decisions of the renderer's recovery that touch no hardware: which
 * session's number a new channel takes on the runlist, which channel holds
 * up the graphics engine when work does not end, what a channel's stop
 * left of it, and the stop's and the reset's parameters.
 *
 * The numbers are handed out after the one handed out last, wrapping, so a
 * number freed now is taken again only after every other free one: an
 * error report the GSP sends late for a channel just freed does not reach
 * the next channel that would have taken the same number.
 *
 * The graphics engine switches channels only between draws (wait for idle
 * preemption), so a draw that never ends keeps its channel on the engine
 * and every other channel's work waits behind it, though that work may have
 * begun (a channel the engine was taken from mid-run).  The channel the
 * engine holds is the culprit; when the engine cannot be asked, the one
 * whose unfinished run began last is (it took the engine from the others).
