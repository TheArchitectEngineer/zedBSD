 * Every session has an address space of its own, its translation tables
 * kept by the driver; the render node's group translates through one
 * slot, and a session's tables are bound to that slot while its work
 * runs.  Work runs one submission at a time under the device's lock: the
 * executor builds a command stream in the session's stage memory, the
 * node's ring calls it and adds one to the node's sync object, and the
 * submission returns once the sync object says the work ended.  The ring
 * and the sync object are mapped at the same addresses in every
 * session's space.
