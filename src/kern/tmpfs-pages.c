 * The page index of one tmpfs file.

 * A regular tmpfs file keeps its data in whole physical pages, found by
 * page number through a radix tree.  Every table of the tree is one
 * physical page of entries, and an entry is the physical address of the
 * table or data page below it with the present bit set, or zero for a hole.
 * Nothing comes from the kernel heap, so a large file neither fills the
 * fixed heap nor makes a release walk a list (BUG-052), and finding a page
 * costs one step for each level of the tree.
 *
 * The caller owns the data pages it inserts until they are in the tree;
 * from then on the tree frees them when it is truncated past them.
