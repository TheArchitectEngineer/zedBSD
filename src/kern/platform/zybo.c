/*
 * The binding of the Digilent ZYBO (Zynq-7010), and of the emulator's
 * xilinx-zynq-a9 machine, which runs the same kernel.
 *
 * The console is a teletype on the PS's UART1, a Cadence UART: the
 * hardware layer writes its output to the UART, and the UART's receive
 * interrupt types what arrives into it.  The board's loader (the JTAG
 * boot, or the emulator's) passes a device tree that describes no
 * device, so the UART is found at the address and interrupt the SoC
 * fixes.
 *
 * The board publishes up to two boot devices: the initial ramdisk the
 * loader placed, when there is one, and the card in the SD slot (SDIO0),
 * when one comes up.  Both are disk images with an MBR.  A loader that
 * placed a ramdisk (the JTAG boot, the emulator's) boots from it, so the
 * ramdisk is the first device, the one the handoff names, and the card
 * the second; without a ramdisk the card is the first.  A root named by
 * the boot parameters (rootpart=/dev/mmcblk0p2) is found on either.
 * The board's Ethernet port (GEM0 and its RTL8211E) is the network
 * interface en0.
 * Halting and rebooting go through the hardware layer (the SLCR's system
 * reset); the board is powered from USB and has no power-off.
 *
 * Values referenced: Linux v6.12 arch/arm/boot/dts/xilinx/zynq-7000.dtsi,
 * uart1's reg (0xe0001000) and its shared peripheral interrupt 50, GIC
 * interrupt 82.
