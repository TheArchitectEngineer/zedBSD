/*
 * The system sleep to idle, S0ix (ws052-p006, plan/ws052/proposed/README-v2.md
 * §7, docs/architecture/power-management.md).
 *
 * The thread of the sleep request is the coordinator.  It freezes the user
 * processes, suspends the devices, tells the firmware (LPS0) and leaves
 * only the wake GPEs and the wake IRQs (the SCI), then sets the state to
 * ENTER and sleeps.  Each CPU's idle loop, finding ENTER, enters the HAL's
 * suspend-to-idle (its tick stopped); when all of them are in, the
 * platform lowers itself to SLP_S0.  The first CPU an interrupt brings
 * back turns ENTER into WAKE and wakes the coordinator, which brings the
 * other CPUs back and works out why the system woke: a note a driver left
 * (the power button, the lid, the AC adapter), a GPE that fired (the
 * embedded controller's is a key unless it only told of a battery; another
 * is a device's PME, USB), or nothing (spurious: everything stays
 * suspended and the CPUs go back to sleep, up to SLEEP_SPURIOUS_MAX times).
 * Then every step is undone in reverse order.
 *
 * CPU 0 brings the tick count forward around its own suspend-to-idle
 * (clock.c), from the counter that keeps running; the coordinator compares
 * the time slept by the counter with the RTC's seconds as a sanity check.
 *
 * The drivers' parts are weak: a platform without them builds this file,
 * and kern_sleep_supported() says it cannot sleep before anything is
 * touched.
