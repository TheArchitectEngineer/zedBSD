 * IPv6 fragment reassembly (RFC 8200 section 4.5).
 *
 * The input hands every packet with a fragment header here.  An atomic
 * fragment (offset 0, no more fragments) goes on at once, on its own
 * (RFC 6946).  Any other is kept, as the packet it came in, in the record
 * of its datagram: the source, the destination, the identification and
 * the device it came in on.  When the record holds the whole of the
 * fragmentable part, the pieces are copied into one packet after the
 * offset-zero fragment's unfragmentable part, without the fragment header,
 * and the input walks on from there.
 *
 * A record lasts 60 seconds from its first fragment.  When it runs out
 * with the offset-zero fragment kept, that fragment is quoted in a Time
 * Exceeded (fragment reassembly time exceeded).  Overlapping fragments
 * throw the whole datagram away, and the record stays, empty and dead,
 * until it runs out, so that the datagram's later fragments are thrown
 * away too (RFC 5722); an exact duplicate is the one exception, dropped
 * alone.  A first fragment whose header chain is cut short is refused
 * with a Parameter Problem (RFC 7112).  The pieces' ECN codepoints are
 * merged as RFC 3168 section 5.3 says.
 *
 * A datagram is reassembled only as large as one packet holds, and a TCP
 * segment only as large as a standard packet holds, so that fragments
 * cannot make the connections queue jumbo packets.  The records, the
 * fragments a record keeps, the fragments kept in all and the jumbo
 * packets among them are bounded.  When a bound is reached the oldest
 * record makes way, but not one whose first fragment came less than a
 * second ago: a stream of new datagrams cannot push out one whose
 * fragments are still arriving.
 *
 * One lock covers the records.  Nothing is freed, sent or referenced
 * while it is held: what leaves a record is chained and freed after.
