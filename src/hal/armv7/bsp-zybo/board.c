 * The Digilent ZYBO (Zynq-7010) board, and the emulator's xilinx-zynq-a9
 * machine, which the same code runs on.
 *
 * The board is booted over JTAG: U-Boot SPL sets up the clocks, the DDR
 * and UART1, and the debugger puts the image at 0x00100000 and a device
 * tree at 0x01f00000 and enters with r2 naming it.  The emulator's ELF
 * loader passes nothing in r2, so a tree the host's script placed at the
 * same 0x01f00000 is taken instead.  The tree describes the memory, the
 * command line and the ramdisk; everything else is at the addresses the
 * SoC has them.
 *
 * The first MiB of RAM is never used (ARMV7_LOW_RAM_SKIP): in the JTAG
 * boot it is on-chip memory, a hole that aborts, and an alias of the high
 * on-chip memory where the second processor waits in the BootROM.  The
 * processor enters secure and the GIC is driven with its groups.  The
 * PL310 level 2 cache is left off; one a loader left on is cleaned and
 * turned off.
