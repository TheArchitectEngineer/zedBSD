/*
 * The armv7 cache maintenance: the level 1 data and instruction caches,
 * by address.
 *
 * The ranges are kernel addresses of the direct map or the image, which
 * never fault.  A partial line at either end of a range to be discarded is
 * written back first, so that the bytes beside the range that share its
 * line are not lost (Procedure referenced: Linux v6.12
 * arch/arm/mm/cache-v7.S, v7_dma_inv_range).  The board's outer cache, if
 * it has one, is off.
 *
 * The Cortex-A9's instruction cache is indexed by virtual address, so a
 * line of the range fetched through another mapping (a user's, while the
 * kernel wrote the code through the direct map) may lie at another index
 * than the range's own; there the whole instruction cache is dropped.  An
 * instruction cache indexed and tagged by physical address (the
 * Cortex-A15's) is dropped by address.  Procedure referenced: Linux v6.12
 * arch/arm/kernel/setup.c, cacheid_init (any ARMv7 instruction cache but
 * a PIPT or an ASID-tagged one taken as aliasing) and arch/arm/mm/flush.c,
 * __sync_icache_dcache (the whole instruction cache then).
 *
 * The instruction cache and the branch predictor are dropped on every
 * processor of the inner shareable domain, as the multiprocessing
 * extensions of both processors allow.
 *
 * Values referenced: ARM DDI 0406C, CTR (DminLine, IminLine and L1Ip),
 * and the maintenance operations DCCMVAC, DCIMVAC, DCCIMVAC, DCCMVAU,
 * ICIMVAU, ICIALLUIS and BPIALLIS.
