 * The GIC of the armv7 boards: its distributor, which routes the shared
 * lines, and each processor's banked private lines and CPU interface.
 *
 * Every line is in Group 0 as the GIC resets it, and the CPU interface
 * signals Group 0 as IRQ (FIQEn stays clear).  On a board whose processor
 * runs in the secure state (the ZYBO under JTAG) the HAL also enables
 * Group 1, which the secure interface acknowledges too; on the emulator's
 * virt board the processor is non-secure and the GIC has no security
 * extensions, and only the enable bits are written.
 *
 * Values referenced: ARM IHI 0048B (GIC architecture version 1 and 2), the
 * distributor's GICD_CTLR, GICD_TYPER, GICD_ISENABLER, GICD_ICENABLER,
 * GICD_ICPENDR, GICD_IPRIORITYR, GICD_ITARGETSR, GICD_ICFGR and GICD_SGIR,
 * and the CPU interface's GICC_CTLR, GICC_PMR, GICC_IAR and GICC_EOIR.
