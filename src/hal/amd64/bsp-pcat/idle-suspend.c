/*
 * The amd64 suspend-to-idle (S0ix) of one CPU (ws052-p006, HAL v2 H1v2).
 *
 * The state is the one the firmware names for low-power S0 idle: the LPIT's
 * first enabled native C-state with a functional-fixed-hardware trigger,
 * whose address is an MWAIT hint (C10 on the Latitude 5330).  The machine
 * can suspend to idle when that hint exists, the CPU has MONITOR/MWAIT with
 * the extensions that break on an interrupt while interrupts are masked
 * and has sub-states for the hint's C-state, and the TSC behind
 * hal_rtc_read_counter() is invariant (it keeps its rate through every
 * C-state).  QEMU/KVM has neither the LPIT nor an invariant TSC, so it is
 * refused there before any device is touched.
 *
 * Around the wait the CPU's periodic tick is stopped and its local
 * interrupt sources quieted, and both are put back before returning.
 * MWAIT is entered with interrupts masked, so an interrupt that arrives
 * between the caller's last check and the MWAIT still ends it; the
 * interrupt is then taken in an sti/nop window before interrupts are
 * masked again, so its handler has run when the call returns.
