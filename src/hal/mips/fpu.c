/*
 * The lazy switch of the MIPS floating-point unit.
 *
 * The unit keeps the registers of one context, its owner.  A switch only
 * names the context that runs next and turns Status.CU1 off; the first
 * floating-point instruction of a context that is not the owner then
 * takes a coprocessor unusable exception, and the handler saves the
 * owner's registers to its state, loads the running context's and makes
 * it the owner.  A context is identified by an address its holder
 * chooses (a task); its state is the struct hal_fpregs it names when it
 * is selected.
 *
 * The unit is used only when Config1 reports it and its implementation
 * register reports 64-bit registers: every context then runs with
 * Status.FR set.  Without both the unit is left off, and every
 * floating-point instruction is a coprocessor unusable fault.
 *
 * Values referenced: MIPS32 Architecture for Programmers Volume III
 * (Config1 FP bit 0, Status CU1 bit 29 and FR bit 26); Volume I (FIR F64
 * bit 22, FCSR Cause bits 12-17).
